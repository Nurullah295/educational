&#x261E; Motion sickness (travel sickness): <br>
Nausea and even Vomiting caused by motion, especially by travelling in a vehicle. It occurs in a car, bus, train, plane, or boat. <br><br>

<br>
<br>

&#x261E; How travel induced vomoting occurs: <br>

Motion is sensed by the brain through different pathways of the nervous system including the inner ear, the eyes, and the tissues of the body surface.<br>

When the body is moved intentionally, for example when walking, the input from all of the pathways are coordinated by our brain.<br>

The symptoms of motion sickness appear when the central nervous system receives conflicting messages from the sensory systems: the inner ear, eyes, skin pressure receptors, and the muscle and joint sensory receptors.<br>

As an example, if someone is sat on a boat or in a car (not looking out of a window), their inner ears sense movement up and down, left and right, but their eyes see a static view, as if they are not moving at all. It is hypothesized that the conflict among the inputs is responsible for motion sickness.<br>

<br>
<br>
&#x261E; Prevention Motion sickness:<br>

&#9734; Take motion sickness medicine before traveling.<br>
&#9734; Choose the right seat. The front passenger seat is best in the car. Choose the midpoint on a boat. Sit over the wing on a plane. Face forward on a train. Sit near a window on a train.<br>
&#9734; Keep your eyes on the horizon.<br>
&#9734; Avoid reading while riding in a car, plane or boat.<br>
&#9734; Avoid  bumps and waves.<br>
&#9734; Get plenty of air.<br>
&#9734; Avoid smells that make you sick (if you can). This includes cigarette smoke.
&#9734; Drink plenty of water. Avoid alcohol.<br>
&#9734; Avoid a heavy meal before or during travel. Eat small portions of plain food instead. Don’t eat greasy, spicy, or acidic foods before or during travel.<br>

<br>
How does hyoscine hydrobromide work?<br><br>

Hyoscine hydrobromide belongs to a group of medicines called anticholinergics or antimuscarinics.<br>

Hyoscine hydrobromide blocks a chemical called acetylcholine. This chemical is found naturally in parts of your brain and nervous system.<br>

Blocking acetylcholine reduces the amount of saliva produced by your salivary glands, as well as secretions in your lungs.<br>

We do not fully understand how hyoscine hydrobromide prevents travel sickness.<br>

It may block messages from your inner ear (which controls balance) to the part of your brain that controls vomiting.<br>

Hyoscine hydrobromide also relaxes the wave-like muscle contractions in the walls of your stomach.<br><br>
