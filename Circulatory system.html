<!-- the human circulatory system with approximate relative percentages of cardiac output delivered to major organ systems -->
<strong>Circulatory System:</strong><br>

The circulatory system, also known as the cardiovascular system or the vascular system, Heart and Vascular system make up cardiovascular system.Consists of the organs and fluids that transport materials across the body. All vertebrates, including humans, have a closed circulatory system, which means that blood remains within blood vessels and does not directly interact with body tissues.<br><br>

<strong>Circulatory System Parts:</strong><br>
The circulatory system consists of-<br>
the heart,<br>
blood, <br>
blood vessels, <br><div class="myDIV">lymph,and</div>
<div class="hide">a colourless fluid containing white blood cells, which bathes the tissues and drains through the lymphatic system into the bloodstream.</div>
lymphatic vessels. <br>
While the heart is the only “organ” of the circulatory system, it is really only a vessel surrounded by muscles. The circulatory system does not have standard organs.<br><br>


<strong>Heart:</strong><br>
Heart is cone-shaped hollow muscle organ.Heart pumps blood to all parts of the body.The heart lies in the thorax,between the lungs and behind the sternum(It is located anterior to the vertebral column and posterior to the sternum).The average human heart, beating at 72 beats per minute, will beat approximately 2.5 billion times during an average 66 year lifespan, each day it beat about 100,000 times, and pumps approximately 4.7-5.7 litres of blood per minute. It weighs approximately 250-300 grams (9 to 11 oz) in females and 300-350 grams (11 to 12 oz) in males.Each day, It cycles through about 6 kg of <div class="myDIV">ATP</div><div class="hide">Adenosine triphosphate</div> daily- 20 to 30 times its own weight- In order to function<br>
The Heart requires large amount of energy to function properly<br>

<strong>Functions of Heart:</strong><br>
Heart pumps blood to all organ which-<br>
1.Deliver oxygen and and nutrients to the tissues.<br>
2.Remove CO<sub>2</sub> and waste products from the tissues.<br>
3.Transport various hormone to different tissues.<br>
<br><br>

<strong>• Chambers of the Heart:</strong>
<img src="img/Circulatory_system-3.jpg" style="width:300px;height:500px;border:0">
<br>
The heart has four hollow chambers, or cavities: two atria and two ventricles.<br>
<b>1.Right Atrium:</b><br>
(receives blood from the veins and pumps it to the right ventricle)<br>
<b>2.Right Ventricle:</b><br>
(receives blood from the right atrium and pumps it to the lungs, where it is loaded with oxygen)<br>
<b>3.Left Atrium:</b><br>
(receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it to the left ventricle).<br>
<b>4.Left Ventricle:</b><br>
(the strongest chamber)(The left ventricle pumps oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body. The left ventricle’s vigorous contractions create our blood pressure)<br> <br>
	
<b>Right Atrium+Right Ventricle(Right Side):</b><br>
Blood supply to lungs.<br>
<b>Left Atrium+Left Ventricle(Left Side):</b><br>
Blood supply to the rest of the body.<br><br>

<b>• Receiving Chambers:</b><br>
Right Atrium & Left Atrium<br>
<b>• Distributing Chambers &#47; Discharging chambers:</b><br>
Left Ventricle & Right Ventricle<br><br>

<br>
<strong>The heart is equipped with four valves:</strong><br>

<b>• 1. Tricuspid Valve/The right atrio-ventricular valve:</b><br>
Between the right atrium & right ventricle.<br>
<b>• 2. Pulmonary Valve:</b><br>
sometimes referred to as the pulmonic valve is the semilunar valve of the heart that lies between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery and has three cusps.<br>
<b>• 3. Mitral Valve/The left atrio-ventricular valve:</b><br>
Between the left atrium & left ventricle.<br>
<b>• 4. Aortic Valve:</b><br>
Between the left ventricle & the aorta.<br><br>

<strong>• Functions of Valves:</strong><br>
Valves mentain the uniderectional flow of blood & prevent back flow.<br><br>

<strong>• Heart Muscle:</strong><br>
The heart muscle has three layers and they are as follows:<br>
<b>• 1.Pericardium:</b><br>
the outer coat.<br>
<b>• 2.Myocardium:</b><br>
the middle muscular coat.<br>
<b>• 3.Endocardium:</b><br>
the inner lining.<br><br>

<b>• Electrocardiogram:</b><br>
Graphical record of the electrical activity of the heart as it contract and relax.This electrical activity is represented by P.Q.R.S and T wave.<br>
The P wave represents Arterial contraction (“the lub”);the QRS wave represents Ventricular contraction (“dub”)<br><br>

<img src="img/Circulatory_system-5.jpg" style="width:500px;height:300px;border:0"><br>
<b>• Electrocardiogram can detect:</b><br>
• Abnormal heart beat.<br>
• Inadequate blood flow.<br>
• Some areas of damage.<br>
• Heart enlargement.<br><br>


<strong>• Heart sound:</strong><br>
An audible sound when valve close.no sound when valve open.<br><br>

<b>• Lub:</b><br>
When tricuspid and mitral valve close(at the beginning of systole).<br>
<b>• Dub:</b><br>
When pulmonary and aortic valve close(at the end of systole).<br><br>


<strong>• Conduction Pathway:</strong><br>
Conduction system of Heart:Special muscle fibers of the heart that conduct electrical impulses throughout the heart muscle(myocardium) is called conduction system of the heart.<br><br>

<strong>• Pacemakers:</strong><br>
Electrical impulses from the heart muscle(midle muscle) cause heart beat(contract).<br>
This electrical signal begins in the Sinoatrial(SA)node. <br>
This <b>SA node</b> is called pacemaker.It is located at the top right of atrium.<br><br>

AVnode:</b><br>
atrioventricular node.<br><br>

<strong>• Conduction pathway:</strong><br>

Electrical impuls from heart muscle &#8594; Signal begins in the SA node &#8594; travels through the muscle fibers to atria and ventricl &#8594; causing atria and ventricle muscle contract.<br>
<img src="img/Circulatory_system-6.jpg" style="width:300px;height:400px;border:0"><br>
If SA node does not work properly,causing the heartbeat too fast,too slow or irregularly.<br>
If electrical pathway blocked,cause an irregular heart rhythm.
</p>

<strong>• Heartbeat:</strong><br>
<p>
Electrical impuls from heart muscle cause to cotract are called heartbeat.<br>
Heartbeat:Heartbeat per minute.
</p>

<strong>• Cardiac Cycle:</strong><br>
<p>
Blood flow through the heart during one complete heartbeat its called CC.<br>
The Cardiac Cycle consists of two parts:<br>

• Systole:<br>
Contraction of the heart muscle(in the ventricles).<br><br>

• Diastole:<br>
Relaxation of the heart muscle(in the ventricles).<br><br>

• Systolic Pressure:<br>
The increased pressure on the arteries due to the cotraction of the ventricles(Heart pumping) is called Systolic Pressure, Normal Value of SBP is 120 mm Hg. (range 90-140 mm Hg).<br><br>

• Diastolic Pressure:<br>
The decreased pressure on the arteries due to relaxation of the ventricles(heart resting) is called diastotic pressure, Normal Value of DBP is 80 mm Hg. (range 60-90 mm Hg).<br><br>

• Normal range:120 mmHg/80 mmHg.<br><br>

• Preload or End diastolic pressuere:<br>

The amount of blood pumped by the heart each minute.<br><br>

• CO=HR × SV<br><br>

• Stroke Volume(SV):<br>
Volume of blood pumped out of the ventricles per heartbeat.<br><br>

• Peripheral resistance: <br>
Peripheral resistance is the resistance of the arteries to blood
flow. As the arteries constrict, the resistance increases and as
they dilate, resistance decreases.<br><br>

• Arterial Pressure:<br>
The pressure of the circulating blood on the arteries.it is the product of cardiac output and vascular resistance..<br><br>
• Mean Arterial Pressure(MAP):<br>
As blood is pumped out of the left ventricle into the arteries,a pressure is generated which is called arterial presure.The Mean Arterial Pressure(MAP) can be determined by the cardiac output(CO),peripheral vascular resistance(PVR).<br><br>

• MAP=CO × PVR<br><br>

• End Systolic volume:<br>
the volume of blood that remains in the ventricle after ventricular systole.volume about 40-50ml.<br><br>

• End Diastolic volume:<br>
the volume of blood that fills the ventricle during diastole.the volume is about 110-120 ml.<br><br>

• Ejecton fraction:<br>
Is the fraction of end diastolic volume that ejested in each systole.It is about 60% of total end diastolic volume.<br><br>

• Blood Pressure:<br>
Lateral pressure of blood on the walls of the blood vessels when flowing through it is called blood pressure.<br><br>

• BP(Blood Pressure)= CO(Cardiac Output) × PR(Peripheral Resistance).<br><br>

• Sympathetic & Parasympathetic Nerve:
Control smooth & visceral muscle

<img src="img/Circulatory_system-13.jpg" style="width:400px;height:100px;border:0"><br>

• Cerebral Vascular Diseases:<br>
• Stroke:<br>
 A stroke is a condition where a blood clot or ruptured artery or blood vessel interrupts blood flow to an area of the brain.<br><br>
 
• Types of Stroke:<br>
&rarr; 1.Ischemic Stroke:<br>
This type of stroke happens wheh blood is blocked from getting to the brain.This offten happens because the artery is clogged with fatty deposits or a blood clot.<br><br>

&rarr; 2.Hemorrhagic stroke:<br>
This type of stroke happens wheh blood vessel in the brain bursts and blood bleeds into the brain.This type of stroke can be caused by an aneurysm--a thin or weak spot in an artery that can burst.<br><br>

• Atherosclerosis:<br>
Deposition of fatty substance inside the blood vessels.<br><br>

• Ischemia:<br>
Decreased blood flow to an organ, usually due to constriction or obstruction of an artery.<br><br>

• Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD): <br>
Narrowing of the coronary arteries and decreased blood flow to the heart<br><br>

• Left Ventricular Hypertrophy(LVH): <br>
Thickning myocardium(muscle)of the Left ventricle of heart.<br><br>

• Heart block(AV block):<br>
Thes are the conditions characterized by a variety of arrhythmias and may present with palpitation,dizziness,syncope due to intermittent tachycardia,bradycardia.it is due to degenerative changes or ischemia of the sinus node.it is of three types:<br><br>
&rarr; 1.First-degree AV(Atrioventricular) block:In this condition the AV conduction is delayed(signals are slowed).First-degree AV block rarely causes any symptoms,and it usually does not require treatment.<br>
&rarr; 2.Second-degree AV block:In this condition dropped beats occur because some impulses from the atria fail to get through to the ventricles(signals are slowed to a large degree).<br>
&rarr; 3.Third-degree or complete AV block:In this condition the AV conduction completely failed,so atria and ventricles beat independently(none of thr electrical signals reach the ventricales.<br><br>

• AV Block:<br>
Impairment of the conduction between the atria(Plural of atrium) and ventricals of the heart.Under normal conditions,SA node in the atria sets the pace of the heart,and these impulses travel down to the ventricles.In an AV block this message dose not reach the ventricles or is impaired along the away.<br><br>
  
• Atherothrombosis:<br>
Atherothrombosis is a characterised by atherosclerotic(derposition of fat) lesion disruption with superimpose thrombus formation.This buildup narrows the arteries,making it harder for blood to flow through.if a blood clot forms,it can stop the blood flow.This can cause a heart attack or stroke.<br><br>

• Coronary artery disease(CAD):<br>
Coronary artery disease is the narrowing or blockage of coronary arteries.usually caused by Atherothrombosis.These plaques can restrict blood flow to the heart muscle by physically clogging the artery or by causing abnormal artery tone and function.<br><br>

• Transient ischemic attack:<br>
A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a transient stroke that lasts only a few minutes.It occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is briefly interrupted.<br><br>

• Peripheral arterial disease(PAD):<br>
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) refers to diseases of the blood vessels (arteries & veins) located outside the heart and brain.It develops when the arteries that supply blood to the internal organs,arms,and legs become completely or partially blocked as a result of atherothrombosis.<br><br>

• Percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI):<br>
Percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI) commonly known as coronary angioplasty or simply angioplasty,is one therapeutic procedure used to treat the stenotic (narrowed) coronary arteries of the heart found in the coronary heart disease.<br><br>

• Hypertensive crisis:<br>
Hypertensive crisis is characterized by Severely elevated blood pressure (equal to or greater than a systolic 180 or diastolic of 110—sometimes termed malignant or accelerated hypertension) is referred to as a hypertensive crisis, as blood pressure at this level confers a high risk of complications. <br>
&rarr; Hypertensive Urgency:<br>
Hypertensive urgency occurs when blood pressure spikes -- blood pressure readings are 180/110 or higher -- but there is no damage to the body's organs. Blood pressure can be brought down safely within a few hours with blood pressure medication.<br>
&rarr; Hypertensive Emergency:<br>
Hypertensive emergency is high blood pressure with potentially life-threatening symptoms and signs indicative of acute impairment of one or more organ systems. Hypertensive urgency is defined as having a systolic blood pressure over 180 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure over 110 mmHg. Hypertensive emergency is defined as elevated blood pressure consistent with hypertensive urgency, plus evidence of impending irreversible hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD).<br>

Organ damage associated with hypertensive emergency may include:<br>

&rarr;Changes in mental status, such as confusion<br>
&rarr;Bleeding into the brain (stroke)<br>
&rarr;Heart failure<br>
&rarr;Chest pain (unstable angina)<br>
&rarr;Fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema)<br>
&rarr;Heart attack<br>
&rarr;Aneurysm (aortic dissection)<br>
&rarr;Eclampsia (occurs during pregnancy)<br><br>

• Risk factors High blood pressure:<br>
The exact cause of high blood pressure are not known, but several risk factors and conditions may play a role in its developemnt, including:<br>

&#9758; Smoking/Using tobacco: <br>
Not only does smoking or chewing tobacco immediately raise your blood pressure temporarily, but the chemicals in tobacco can damage the lining of your artery walls. This can cause your arteries to narrow and increase your risk of heart disease. Secondhand smoke also can increase your heart disease risk.<br>

&#9758; Being overweight or obese:<br>
The more you weigh the more blood you need to supply oxygen and nutrients to your tissues. As the volume of blood circulated through your blood vessels increases, so does the pressure on your artery walls.<br>
 
&#9758; Lack of physical activity:<br>
People who are inactive tend to have higher heart rates. The higher your heart rate, the harder your heart must work with each contraction and the stronger the force on your arteries. Lack of physical activity also increases the risk of being overweight.<br>

&#9758; Too much salt (sodium) in the diet:<br>
Too much sodium in your diet can cause your body to retain fluid, which increases blood pressure.<br>

&#9758; Too little potassium in the diet:<br>
Potassium helps balance the amount of sodium in your cells. If you don't get enough potassium in your diet or retain enough potassium, you may accumulate too much sodium in your blood.

&#9758; Too much alcohol consumption:<br>
Over time, heavy drinking can damage your heart. Having more than one drink a day for women and more than two drinks a day for men may affect your blood pressure. If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men. One drink equals 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof liquor.<br>

&#9758; Stress: <br>
High levels of stress can lead to a temporary increase in blood pressure. If you try to relax by eating more, using tobacco or drinking alcohol, you may only increase problems with high blood pressure.<br>

&#9758; Older Age:<br>
The risk of high blood pressure increases as you age. Until about age 64, high blood pressure is more common in men. Women are more likely to develop high blood pressure after age 65.<br>

&#9758; Genetics<br>

&#9758; Family history of High blood pressure.<br>

&#9758; Certain chronic conditions:<br>
Certain chronic conditions also may increase your risk of high blood pressure, such as kidney disease, diabetes and sleep apnea.<br>

<strong>Blood vessels:</strong><br>
<img src="img/Circulatory_system-10.jpg" style="width:300px;height:300px;border:0"><br>
<p>
The Blood vessels are hollow tube,which carry the blood and nutrient to the tissue.<br><br>
</p>
<P>

&#9734;   Vein:<br>
 The veins are collapsible vessels, which carry de-oxygenated blood. The function of vein is transport blood from tissue back to heart. But pulmonary vein carry oxygenated blood back to heart. the veins have thinner walls than the arteries, but have the same four coats. the middle coat is comparatively thin and contains less muscle and elastic tissue so that the veins easily collapse. the capillaries unite to form small veins or venules. these unite with other small veins to form larger veins, which ultimately unite to form two large veins, the superior and inferior venaecava which end into the right atrium of the heart.<br><br>
&#9734;   Artery:<br>
The arteries are the stout walled vessels that withstand the pressure of the blood.They carry oxygenated blood.The function of arteries is to transport blood to the tissue from heart.But pulmonary artery carry de-oxygenated blood in to lungs.<br><br>

&#9734;   The walls of the artery consists of three coats:<br>

&rarr; 1.Tunica adventitia:<br>
an outer sheath of fibrous tissue.<br>

&rarr; 2.Tunica media:<br>
a thick coat composed of involuntary muscle and elastic fibrous tissue.<br>

3.Tunica intima:<br>
a lining of endothelium which provides a smooth surface for the blood to flow over.<br><br>

&#9734;   There are two distinct types of artery:<br>

&rarr; 1.The large artery,which distributes blood to the verious organs and<br>

&rarr; 2.The arteriole,which divides into capillaries with in the various organs and gaseous exchange occur here.<br><br>
&#9734;   Capillaries:<br>
The Capillaries are fine, hair like blood vessels, microscopic in size. they join the arterioles to the venules. In which gas/nutrient/waste exchange occurs.<br><br>

&#9734;   The blood:<br>
The blood is thick,red,fluid of connective tissue.It is composed of red corpuscles, white cells, platelets, and blood plasma. It is transported throughout the body within blood vessels.It delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells.<br><br>

&#9734;   Volume of blood:<br>
About 1/12 of the weight of the body or about 5-6 litres.<br><br>

&#9734;   Composition of blood:<br>

&#9734;   A. Cellular substance:45%<br>
(A blood cell, also called a hematocyte, is a cell produced by hematopoiesis and normally found in blood. In mammals, these fall into three general categories:)<br>
&rarr; 1.Red blood cells(Erythrocytes)<br>

&rarr; 2.White blood cells(Leukocytes)<br>

&rarr; 3.Platelets(Thrombocytes)<br><br>

&#9734;   B. Plasma:55%<br>

&rarr; 1.Water(91-92%)<br>

&rarr; 2.Solid part(8-9%)<br><br>

&#9734;   The plasma or fluid part of the blood is clear,straw clored,watery fluid.It consist of:<br><br>

&rarr; 1.Water-forms over 90% of the whole.<br>

&rarr; 2.Mineral salt-these include chloride phosphates and carbonates of sodium,potassium and calcium.<br>

&rarr; 3.Plasma proteins;albumin,globulin,fibrinogen,prothrombin and heparin.<br>

&rarr; 4.Food stuffs in their simplest form:glucose,amino acids,fatty acids and glecerol and vitamins.<br>

&rarr; 5.Gases in solution:oxygen,carbon dioxide and nitrogen<br>

&rarr; 6.Waste products from the tissues;urea,uric acid and creatinine.<br>

&rarr; 7.Antibodies and antitoxins which protect the body against bacterial infection.<br>

&rarr; 8.Hormones from the ductless glands.<br>

&rarr; 9.Enzymes.<br><br>

&#9734;   Red blood cell:<br>
Mature red blood cells are flexible and oval biconcave disks.They lack a cell nucleus and most organelles, in order to accommodate maximum space for hemoglobin. Approximately 2.4 million new erythrocytes are produced per second.The red blood & others blood cells develop in the bone marrow(In the embryo, the liver & spleen are the site of red blood cell production.)and circulate for about 100–120 days in the body before their components are recycled by macrophages(life span 120 days,80 to 90 days in a full term infant,blood donation every 4 month). Each circulation takes about 20 seconds. Approximately a quarter of the cells in the human body are red blood cells.Men have about 45-55 lac erythrocytes per microliter (cubic millimeter) of blood and women about 40-50 lac.Human red blood cells take on average 20 seconds to complete one cycle of circulation.<br><br>

Hemoglobin consists mostly of iron & protein subunits(the "globin" molecules).The globin of the haemoglobin is broken down in to amino-acid to be used as protein in the tissues and the iron in the haem is removed for use in the formation of future of red blood cells.the rest of the haem is converted in to bilirubin.<br><br>

• Amount of Hemoglobin present in normal blood:<br>
Men have about 14-17 gm/100ml blood,and women12-15/100ml blood.<br><br>

<strong>• Function of hemoglobin:</strong><br>
&rarr; 1.Carry oxygen from lungs to the body tissue (through erteries)and trasport of carbon-dioxide back to the lungs(through vein)<br>

&rarr; 2.Work as a buffer.<br><br>


<strong>• Iron:</strong><br>

<img src="img/Circulatory_system-12.jpg" style="width:300px;height:300px;border:0"><br>

Iron is an essential element(mineral) for blood production and supports many other bodily functions. About 70 percent of our body's iron is found in the red blood cells of our blood called hemoglobin and in muscle cells called myoglobin. Hemoglobin is essential for transferring oxygen in our blood from the lungs to the tissues. Myoglobin, in muscle cells, accepts, stores, transports and releases oxygen. Iron also is needed for proper immune function. When iron stores are exhausted, the condition is called iron depletion. Further decreases may be called iron-deficient erythropoiesis and still further decreases produce iron deficiency anemia.<br><br>

2 Types of Iron:<br>
&#9758; 1. Heme iron: Heme iron is a form of iron found only in blood(Hemoglobin) and muscle tissue(Myoglobin).<br>

&#9758; 2. None-Heme iron: is found in plant-based foods like grains, fruits, vegetables. Non-heme iron is also found in animal products such as eggs or milk/dairy and it is also comprises more than half the iron contained in animal meat.<br><br>

&#x2600; Haematopoiesis:
Blood cell formation, or hematopoiesis, occurs in red bone marrow, or myeloid tissue.<br><br>

&#x2600; Role of Iron:<br>

&#x21E8; Haemoglobin formation:<br>
One of the most important functions of iron is heme synthesis, which forms haemoglobin, a protein found in red blood cells. <br>

&#x21E8; Oxygen carrier: <br>
Haemoglobin’s primary role is to transport oxygen from the lungs to body tissues to maintain basic life functions.<br>

<strong>&#x21E8; Brain function:</strong><br>
Our brain use 20% oxygen fron from blood circularion in Brain, Iron transport oxygen to body tissues to maintain Brain function.

&#x21E8; Iron deficiency Anemia:Iron plays a vital role to prevent Iron deficiency Anemia<br>

&#x21E8; Iron helps maintain a normal immune system: Iron is necessary for immune cell creation and growth, which help to keep us healthy.<br>

&#x21E8; IIron helps convert food to energy: Iron plays a vital role in the process by which cells make energy. Human cells require iron in order to convert energy from food into ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) and this is the body’s primary energy source. <br><br>


• Anemia:<br>
Anemia is a decrease in number of red blood cells (RBCs) or less than the normal quantity of hemoglobin in the blood.<br><br>

• Cause of anaemia:<br>
&#9758; 1.The most common cause of anemia is blood loss.<br>

&#9758; 2. Iron deficiency.<br>

&#9758; 3. Hemolysis.<br>

&#9758; 4. Destroy of bonemarrow and deficiency of vitamin B.<br>
 আমাদের দেশে Iron deficiency ও Deficiency of vitamin B এই কারনে  Anaemia বেশী হয়।  <br><br>

<strong>• Function of RBC:</strong><br>

&#9758; 1. The red blood cells transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues in the body. <br>

&#9758; 2. They also carry carbon dioxide from the body tissues to the lungs. <br>

&#9758; 3. Manage acid-base balance by the red blood cell <br>

&#9758; 4. RBC manage blood Viscosity<br><br>

• White blood cell:<br>
White blood cells or leucocytes ("white cells") are complete cells because they contain a nucleus and other vital organelles.Which are transparent and not coloured,larger and fewer than the red.White blood cells ( WBCs ) are the cells of the immune system that are involved in defending the body against both infectious disease and foreign invaders. Five different and diversetypes of leukocytes exist, and several types (including monocytes and neutrophils) are phagocytic . All leukocytes are produced and derived from a multipotent cell in the bone marrow known as a hematopoietic stem cell . They live for about three to four days in the average human body. Leukocytes are found throughout the body, including the blood and lymphatic system. The number of leukocytes in the blood is often an indicator of disease.
per microliter of blood. [3] They make up approximately 1% of the total blood volume in a healthy adult. An increase in the number of leukocytes over the upper limits is called leukocytosis , and a decrease below the lower limit is called leukopenia . Physical properties of leukocytes (such as volume, conductivity, and granularity) may change. These changes can be due to activation, the presence of immature cells, or the presence of malignant leukocytes in leukemia .<br><br>

• Quantity:4000-11000/cubic millimetre of blood.<br><br>

• Shelf life: Some hours Some day.<br><br>

• Site of WBC formation:Bone Marrow, Spleen, Tonsil.<br><br>

• Types of WBC:<br>
There are three types WBC.<br><br>

&#9758; 1.Granulocytes(Polymorphoneuclear leucocytes also known as Granulocytes)<br>

• a. Neutrophils-<br>
About 62%,absorb both acid and alkaline dyes,they have the ability to ingest smal particles like bacteria and cell debris.This power is called phagocytosis and they are known as phagocytes.<br>

• b. Eosinophils-<br>
About 2%,absorb acid dyes and stain red.an increase in number occurs during allergic states such as asthma and during infestations of worms.<br>

• c.Basophils-<br>
About 4%,absorbs alkaline or basic dyes and stain blue.They contain heparin and histamine.<br><br>

&#9758; 2.Monocytes-<br>
About 6%,They are the largest of white blood cells and have a horse-shoe shaped nucleus.They show both amoeboid movement and phagocytosis.<br><br>
 
&#9758; 3.Lymphocytes-<br>
About 30%,They show some amoeboid movement but are not actively phagocytic.They are concerned in the production of antibdies.<br><br>

<strong>Function of White Blood Cell:</strong><br>

&#9758; 1. The granulocytes and monocytes play a very important part in the protecting the body from micro organisms.By phagocytic action they ingest living bacteria.<br>

&#9758; 2. Increase immunity by making antibody.<br><br>

• Platelets:<br>
Platelets are small cells about one third the size of a red blood cell.<br><br>

• Site of WBC formation: Bone marrow.<br><br>

• Life span: 8-12 days.<br><br>

• Volume:1-3 lac/ml blood.<br><br>

<strong>• Function of Platelets:</strong> <br>
They play an important part in the control of bleeding after injury and in the clotting of blood.
Blood circulation:The circuit of blood through the arteries,arterioles,capillaries,venules and veins and back to the <br><br>

<strong>• The Function of blood:</strong><br>
&#8688; 01. To carry food to the tissues.<br>
&#8688; 02. To carry oxygen to the tissues in oxy-haemoglobin.<br>
&#8688; 03. To carry water to the tissues.<br>
&#8688; 04. To carry away waste priducts to the organ which excrete them.<br>
&#8688; 05. To fight bacterial infection through the white cells and antibodies.<br>
&#8688; 06. To provide the materials from which glands make their secretions.<br>
&#8688; 07. To distribute heat evently throughout the body,and so regulate body temperature.<br>
&#8688; 08. To arrest haemorrhage through clotting.<br><br>

&#x261E; Human Blood Groups:<br>
Although whole blood transfusions can save lives, people have different blood groups, and transfusing incompatible or mismatched blood can be fatal.<br><br>

• Antigen. An antigen is a substance that the body recognizes as foreign; it stimulates the immune system to release antibodies or use other means to mount a defense against it.<br><br>

• Antibodies. One person’s RBC proteins will be recognized as foreign if transfused into another person with different RBC antigens; the “recognizers” are antibodies present in the plasma that attach to RBCs bearing surface antigens different from those on the patient’s (blood recipient’s) RBCs.<br><br>

• Agglutination. Binding of the antibodies causes the foreign RBCs to clump, a phenomenon called agglutination, which leads to the clogging of small blood vessels throughout the body.<br><br>

• ABO blood groups. The ABO blood groups are based on which of two antigens, type A or type B, a person inherits; absence of both antigens results in type O blood, presence of both antigens leads to type AB, and the presence of either A or B antigen yields type A or B blood.<br><br>

• Rh blood groups. The Rh blood groups are so named because one of the eight Rh antigens (agglutinogen D) was originally identified in Rhesus monkeys; later the same antigen was discovered in human beings; most Americans are Rh+ (Rh positive), meaning that their RBCs carry the Rh antigen.<br><br>

• Anti-Rh antibodies. Unlike the antibodies of the ABO system, anti-Rh antibodies are not automatically formed and present in the blood of Rh- (Rh-negative) individuals.<br><br>

• Hemolysis. Hemolysis (rupture of RBCs) does not occur with the first transfusion because it takes time for the body to react and start making antibodies.<br><br>

&#x261E; Blood Typing<br>

The importance of determining the blood group of both the donor and the recipient before blood is transfused is glaringly obvious.<br><br>
• Blood typing of ABO blood groups. When serum containing anti-A or anti-B antibodies is added to a blood sample diluted with saline, agglutination will occur between the antibody and the corresponding antigen.<br><br>

• Cross matching. Cross matching involves testing for agglutination of donor RBCs by the recipient’s serum and of the recipient’s RBCs by the donor serum;<br><br>

• Blood typing for Rh factors. Typing for the Rh factors is done in the same manner as ABO blood typing.<br><br>

<strong>• Blood Circulation:</strong><br>

<p>• Definition:
The system that circulates blood  from the heart through the arteries, capillaries, and veins back again to the heart.</p>

Right side of the heart:<br>
Blood enters the heart through two large veins, the inferior and superior vena cava, emptying oxygen-poor blood from the body into the right atrium of the heart.<br>

As the atrium contracts, blood flows from your right atrium into your right ventricle through the open tricuspid valve.<br>

When the ventricle is full, the tricuspid valve shuts. This prevents blood from flowing backward into the atria while the ventricle contracts.<br>
• As the ventricle contracts, blood leaves the heart through the pulmonic valve, into the pulmonary artery and to the lungs where it is oxygenated. Note that oxygen-poor or CO2 containing blood goes through the pulmonary artery to the lungs where CO2 is exchanged for O2.<br>

Left side of the heart:<br>
(operating at the same time as the right side of the heart)
The pulmonary vein empties oxygen-rich blood from the lungs into the left atrium of the heart.
As the atrium contracts, blood flows from your left atrium into your left ventricle through the open mitral valve.<br>

When the ventricle is full, the mitral valve shuts. This prevents blood from flowing backward into the atrium while the ventricle contracts.<br>

As the ventricle contracts, oxygen-enriched blood leaves the heart through the aortic valve, into the aorta and to the arteries and eventually into veins to complete the blood circulation in your body.<br><br>

• Classification of Circulatory System:<br>

• Systemic Circulation(Peripheral Circulation):<br>
 Carries blood from the heart to all the other parts of the body and back again. The part of blood circulation that carries oxygenated blood away from the heart, to the body, and returns deoxygenated blood back to the heart(Left ventricle to right atrium).<br><br>
 
• Pulmonary Circulation:<br>
Blood circulation between heart and lungs.Pulmonary circulation is the movement of blood from the heart to the lungs for oxygenation, then back to the heart again . (Right ventricle to lungs to left atrium).<br><br>
• Coronary Circulation:<br>
Blood is supplied to the heart by its own vascular system(coronary artery).<br><br>

• Portal Circulation:<br>
Blood circulation from the Capillaries of one organ through larger vessels to Capillaries of another organ before returning to heart.circulation of blood to the liver from the small intestine, the right half of the colon, and the spleen through the portal vein; sometimes specified as the hepatic portal circulation.<br>
