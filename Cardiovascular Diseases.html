    </div>

    <strong>1. Angina:</strong><br>
    Angina is chest pain or discomfort caused when the heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. It is
    also called angina pectoris and is often described as squeezing, pressure, heaviness, tightness or pain in chest.
    <br>
    <strong>2. Aortic stenosis:</strong><br>
    Aortic stenosis (AS or AOS) is the narrowing of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the
    aorta begins), such that problems result. It may occur at the aortic valve as well as above and below this level. It
    typically gets worse over time.
    <br>
    <strong>3. Arrythmia:</strong><br>
    An abnormal or irregular heartbeat. Tachycardia (>100 bpm) and Bradycardia (<60 bpm).
    <br>
    <strong>4. Atherosclerosis:</strong><br>
    A potentially serious condition where arteries become clogged with fatty substances called plaque.
    <br>
    <strong>5. Blood Pressure:</strong><br>
    Lateral pressure of blood on the walls of the blood vessels when flowing through it.
    <br>
    <strong>6. Cardiac Excitability:</strong><br>
    It is the ability of a cardiac cell to generate an action potential at its membrane in response to
    depolarization and to transmit an impulse along the membrane.
    <br>
    <strong>7. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF):</strong><br>
    Failure of the heart to pump adequate blood to meet the body's demand.
    <br>
    <strong>8. Coronary Artery Diseases (CAD):</strong><br>
    A narrowing of the arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart. The condition
    results from a buildup of plaque and greatly increases the risk of a heart attack.
    <br>
    <strong>9. Diastolic Pressure:</strong><br>
    It is the minimum pressure of blood while ventricles are relaxed. Optimum level of DBP is 80 mmHg.
    <br>
    <strong>10. Dysbetalipoproteinemia:</strong><br>
    It is a rare familial dyslipidemia where there is elevation of serum cholesterol and
    triglyceride in blood.
    <br>
    <strong>11. Dyslipidemia:</strong><br>
    High level of lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides or both) carried by lipoproteins in the blood.
    <br>
    <strong>12. Essential (primary) hypertension (90%):</strong><br>
    Hypertension in which no underlying cause has been identified.
    <br>
    <strong>13. HDL-C:</strong><br>
    High density lipoprotein (good cholesterol) reduces, reuses, and recycles LDL cholesterol by transporting it to
    the liver where it can be reprocessed.
    <br>
    <strong>14. Heart Failure:</strong><br>
    Heart failure is a chronic, progressive condition in which the heart muscle is unable to pump enough
    blood to meet the body's needs for blood and oxygen.
    <br>
    <strong>15. Hypercholesterolemia:</strong><br>
    Also called high cholesterol, is the presence of high levels of low-density lipoprotein
    cholesterol (LDL-C) or non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) in the blood.
    <br>
    <strong>16. Hypertension:</strong><br>
    It is also known as high blood pressure or arterial hypertension - a chronic medical condition in which
        the blood pressure in the arteries is elevated. A systolic pressure above 140 mmHg, or a diastolic pressure over 90
        mmHg are designed as hypertension.
    <br>
    <strong>17. Hypertensive Urgency:</strong><br>
    Hypertensive urgency is a marked elevation in blood pressure without evidence of target
            organ damage. Hypertensive urgency happens when blood pressure readings occur at 180/110 or higher.
    <br>
    <strong>18. Hypertriglyceridemia:</strong><br>
    A condition in which triglyceride levels are elevated in blood.
    <br>
    <strong>19. Ischemia:</strong><br>
    Decreased blood flow to an organ, usually due to constriction or obstruction of an artery.
    <br>
    <strong>20. Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD):</strong><br>
    Narrowing of the coronary arteries and decreased blood flow to the heart.
    <br>
    <strong>21. LDL-C:</strong><br>
    LDL is called low-density lipoprotein because LDL particles tend to be less dense than other kinds of cholesterol
     particles. LDL-C is usually termed the "bad" cholesterol.
    <br>
    <strong>22. Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH):</strong><br>
        Thickening of the myocardium (muscle) of the left ventricle of heart.
        <br>
    <strong>23. Lipoproteins:</strong><br>
        Lipoproteins are the particles that transport cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood stream.
        <br>
    <strong>24. Myocardial Infarction (MI):</strong><br>
        Myocardial necrosis resulting from an insufficient supply of oxygenated blood to an area
    of the heart. Myocardial Infarction is also known as heart attack.
        <br>
    <strong>25. Obstructive coronary artery disease:</strong><br>
        It is the gradual narrowing or closing of arteries that supply the heart with
    blood. This blockage is usually caused by a build-up of plaque (atherosclerosis), and can begin as early as to the teens,
    slowly worsening in some people and more quickly in others.
        <br>
    <strong>26. Pedal oedema:</strong><br>
        It is the accumulation of fluid in the feet and lower legs.
        <br>
        <strong>27. Peripheral resistance:</strong><br>
        It is the resistance of the arteries to blood flow. As the arteries constrict, the resistance
    increases and as they dilate, resistance decreases.
        <br>
      <strong>28. Secondary hypertension (10%):</strong><br>
        Hypertension that is due to identifiable disorders, such as excess renin secretion by
    the kidneys, arteriosclerosis, or hyperthyroidism.
        <br>
          <strong>29. Stroke:</strong><br>
        A stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain causes cell death. There are two main
    types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. Both cause parts of the brain
    to stop functioning properly.
        <br>
              <strong>30. Systolic Pressure:</strong><br>
        It is the maximum pressure of blood while the ventricles are contracted. Optimum level of SBP is
    120 mmHg.
        <br>
                  <strong>31. TC:</strong><br>

        <br>
                      <strong>32. TG:</strong><br>

        <br>
                          <strong>33. Vascular tone:</strong><br>

    <strong>Mixed Dyslipidemia:</strong><br>
                            It is the combination of elevated LDL cholesterol and triglyceride and decreased HDL Cholesterol. It may occur with certain genetic disorders, diabetes mellitus, the metabolic syndrome, or the use of drugs such as immunosuppressive agents or protease inhibitors.<br>

   <strong>Hypertriglyceridemia:</strong><br>
                            It is a condition in which triglyceride levels are elevated. It is often caused or exacerbated by uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, obesity and sedentary habits. It is a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD).<br>

   <strong>Dysbetalipoproteinemia:</strong><br>
                            It is also called remnant removal disease. It is a rare lipid disorder characterized by high levels of blood cholesterol and triglycerides. Cholesterol levels: 300-600 mg/dL. Triglyceride Ievels>400 mg/dL and may exceed 1000 mg/dL.<br>

   <strong>Atherosclerosis:</strong><br>
