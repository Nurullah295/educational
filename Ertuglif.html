<b>Two Lines Magic Detailing of Ertuglif</b> <br>
Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
Good morning/evening.<br>
Ertuglif is better than Empagliflozin in reducing HbA1c & FPG
(Fasting Plasma Glucose) and weight. Ertuglif significantly reduces
CV death risk (17%) & heart failure-related hospitalization (30%)
& Improves renal outcomes by preserving eGFR (Estimated
Glomerular Filtration Rate) & reducing UACR (Urine Albumin to
Creatinine Ratio).<br>
So, considering above benefits, may I expect 2 prescriptions daily in favor of Ertuglif? Thank you sir/madam, for giving your valuable time.<br>

<b>Prescribing information</b><br>
Composition:<br>
 Ertuglif 5:<br>
Each film coated tablet contains Ertugliflozin L-Pyroglutamic Acid INN equivalent to Ertugliflozin 5 mg.<br>
 Ertuglif 15:<br>
 Each film coated tablet contains Ertugliflozin L-Pyroglutamic Acid INN
equivalent to Ertugliflozin 15 mg. <br>
Pharmacology: <br>
SGLT2 is the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. Ertugliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2. By inhibiting SGLT2, ertugliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.<br>
 Indication:<br>
 Ertugliflozin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glyceemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. <br>
Dosage & Administration: <br>
The recommended starting dose of Ertugliflozin is 5 mg once daily taken in the moming with or without food. In patients tolerating Ertugliflozin 5 mg once daily, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 15 mg once daily if additional glycaemic control is needed or as directed by the physician.<br>
Contraindication: <br>
Severe renal impairment, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or dialysis. History of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to Ertugliflozin. <br>
Warnings & Precautions: <br>
Hypotension: <br>
Hypotension may occur particularly in patients with renal impairment the elderly or patients on diuretics. Signs and symptoms should be monitored during therapy. <br>
Ketoacidosis:<br>
 Patients who are present with signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis for ketoacidosis, regardless of blood glucose level should be assured. If suspected, discontinue, evaluate and treat promptly. Before initiating, consider risk factors for ketoacidosis. Patients may require monitoring and temporary discontinuation of therapy in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis. Acute Kidney Injury and Impairment in Renal Function: If acute kidney injury occurs, discontinue and promptly treat. <br>
Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis:<br> 
Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated. Lower Limb <br>
Amputation: <br>
An increased risk for lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in clinical studies with another SGLT2 inhibitor. Before initiating, factors that may increase risk of amputation should be considered. Patients for infections or ulcers of lower limbs should be monitored and discontinued if these occur. <br>
Hypoglycemia:<br>
 A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue to reduce risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination. Genital Mycotic Infections: Ertugliflozin increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. <br>
LDL-C:<br>
 Dose-related increases in LDL-C can occur with Ertugliflozin.<br>
Side Effects: <br>
The most common adverse reactions associated with Ertugliflozin incidence ≥ 5% ) are female genital mycotic infections.<br>
Use in Pregnancy & Lactation:<br>
 Pregnancy: <br>
Ertugliflozin is not recommended during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The limited available data with Ertugliflozin in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy.<br>
Lactation:<br>
Ertugliflozin is not recommended while breastfeeding.<br>
Use in Children & Adolescents:<br>
 Pediatric Use:<br>
 Safety and effectiveness of Ertugliflozin in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established. <br>
Geriatric Use: <br>
No dosage adjustment of Ertugliflozin is recommended based on age. <br>
Drug Interactions: <br>
Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues. Ertugliflozin
may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with Ertugliflozin. <br>
Overdosage: <br>
In the event of an overdose with Ertugliflozin contact the Poison Control Center. Employ the usual supportive measures as dictated by the patient's clinical status. Removal of ertugliflozin by hemodialysis has not been studied. <br>
Storage: <br>
Store below 30°C, away from light and in a dry place. Keep all medicines out of the reach of children. <br>
