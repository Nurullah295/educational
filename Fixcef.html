<p class="FQ">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</p>
<p class="FQ"> 1) Why is Clavulanic acid added with Cefuroxime?</p>
Ans: Clavulanic Acid is a beta-lactamase inhibitor which blocks the action of enzymes produced by bacteria
to inactivate Cefuroxime. Clavulanic Acid reduces resistance and enhances the activity of Cefuroxime
against bacteria.<br><br>

<p class="FQ"> 2) What is the benefit of packaging and formulation of our Fixcef Plus Tablet?</p>
Ans: 
<li>No solvent is used in this product to ensure protection from moisture.</li>
<li>Moisture protective opadry polymer coating.</li>
<li>Silica gel strongly protects from external moisture.</li>
<li>Alu-Alu blister pack & Sachet protects from external moisture & light.</li>
<br>
<p class="FQ">The resistance rate of Cefuroxime & Cefuroxime+Clavulanic acid</p>
The resistance rate of single Cefuroxime is:<br>
<b>67.50%</b><br>
but in case of combination of Cefuroxime +Clavulanic Acid is only:<br>
<b>2.5%</b><br>

<p class="FQ"> 3) Why is Cefuroxime+Clavulanic acid the drug of choice in UTI to Gynecologists?</p>
Ans: Cefuroxime+Clavulanic acid shows 97% clinical success rate in UTIs. The resistance rate of single
Cefuroxime is 67.50% but in case of combination of Cefuroxime +Clavulanic Acid is only 2.5%. USFDA
approved both Cefuroxime+Clavulanic acid is pregnancy category B.

<p class="FQ"> Why is clavulanic acid called a suicide inhibitor?</p>
Clavulanic acid, which inhibits β-lactamase: clavulanic acid covalently bonds to a serine residue in the active site of the β-lactamase, restructuring the clavulanic acid molecule, creating a much more reactive species that attacks another amino acid in the active site, permanently inactivating it, and thus inactivating the enzyme β-lactamase.<br>

For Gynaecologists:<br>
Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
Every day you get a lot of patients who are suffering from urinary tract infections. To overcome this
problem you always choose resistance free antibiotic. Am I right Sir?<br>
Cefuroxime+Clavulanic acid shows 97% clinical success rate in UTIs. The resistance rate of single
Cefuroxime is 67.50% but in case of combination of Cefuroxime +Clavulanic Acid is only 2.5%. USFDA
approved both Cefuroxime+Clavulanic acid pregnancy category B.<br>
Considering these benefits, may I expect 3 Rx daily in favor of Fixcef Plus? Fixcef Plus is available in all
nearby shops of your chamber. So, your Rx will not be dishonored.<br>
Thank you sir, for giving me your valuable time.<br><br>

For ENT Sp.<br>
Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
Every day you get a lot of patients who are suffering from various URTI (Upper Respiratory Tract
Infections). To overcome these problem you always choose resistance free antibiotic. Am I right Sir?<br>
Cefuroxime+Clavulanic acid shows clinical success rate in Tonsillitis 94.5%, Otitis media 94.3% &
Maxillary sinusitis 89.2%. The resistance rate of single Cefuroxime is 67.50% but in case of combination
of Cefuroxime +Clavulanic Acid is only 2.5%.<br>
Considering these benefits, may I expect 2 Rx daily in favor of Fixcef Plus? Fixcef Plus is available in all
nearby shops of your chamber. So, your Rx will not be dishonored. <br>
Thank you sir, for giving me your valuable time.<br><br>

For Chest Sp.<br>
Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
Every day you get a lot of patients who are suffering from various LRTI (Lower Respiratory Tract
Infections). An untreated LRTI can cause bacterial pneumonia and lead to lung damage. So, with proper
antibiotic can easily prevent the serious consequences. Am I right Sir?<br>
Cefuroxime+Clavulanic acid shows excellent success rate in LRTI (Bronchopneumonia 90%, Pre-
Operative Pneumonia 91% and Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis 89%). The resistance rate of
single Cefuroxime is 67.50% but in case of combination of Cefuroxime +Clavulanic Acid is only 2.5%.<br>
Considering these benefits, may I expect 2 Rx daily in favor of Fixcef Plus? Fixcef Plus is available in all
nearby shops of your chamber. So, your Rx will not be dishonored. <br>
Thank you sir, for giving me your valuable time.<br><br>

GP:<br>
Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
Every day you get a lot of patients who are suffering from bacterial infections and it is difficult to handle
when antibiotic says "I'm Service Out" (when antibiotic does not work properly that means antibiotic
resistance). To overcome the antibiotic resistance you always choose Cefuroxime+Clavulanic acid. Am I
right Sir?<br>
We know, β-lactamases are a class of bacterial enzymes responsible for bacterial resistance to β-lactam antibiotics like Cefuroxime. Cefuroxime inhibits bacterial cell walls which ultimately bacteria death. On the other hand Clavulanic acid permanently inactivates the beta-lactamase enzymes. That's why Complete protection against resistant pathogens. Fixcef Plus ensures dual mechanism which provides
better bacterial coverage.<br>
Considering these benefits, may I expect 3 Rx daily in favor of Fixcef Plus? Fixcef Plus is available in all
nearby shops of your chamber. So, your Rx will not be dishonored.<br>
Thank you sir, for giving me your valuable time.<br><br>

Short Detailing:<br>
Dear Sir/Madam:<br>
Good morning/ evening. If you permit, today I would like to share some information/ new information
on Fixcef Plus, combination of Cefuroxime+Clavulanic acid. Every day you are getting many patients who
are suffering from bacterial infections and it is difficult to handle when antibiotic says "I'm Service Out”
that means when antibiotic does not work properly known as antibiotic resistance. To overcome the
antibiotic resistance, you always prefer Cefuroxime+Clavulanic acid. Am I right Sir?<br>
You can prefer Fixcef Plus, because it is a/an-<br>
<li>Ultimate choice for resistant pathogens</li>
<li>"Suicidal inhibitor" of β-lactamase</li>
<li>Significantly increases the sensitivity of Cefuroxime</li>
