function & GFR is less than 60 that lasts for three months or more.
1. CKD: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) can be defined as the occurrence of kidney damage and/or reduced kidney
usually >90 ml/min/1.73m2.
2. GFR: Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is a test used to check how well the kidneys are working. "Normal" GFR is
3. Gonorrhoea: It is a Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Infected men
may experience pain or burning with urination, discharge from the penis, or testicular pain. Infected women may
experience burning with urination, vaginal discharge, vaginal bleeding between periods, or pelvic pain.
4. Hyperphosphatemia: Having too much phosphorus in blood is called hyperphosphatemia.
5. Infection of the bladder (cystitis): This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). All women are at risk
opening to the bladder.
of cystitis because of their anatomy, specifically the short distance from the urethra to the anus and the urethral
6. Infection of the urethra (urethritis): This type of UTI can occur when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra.
7. Nephron: The nephron is the structural and functional unit of the kidney.
bone marrow makes fewer red blood cells, causing anemia.
8. Renal Anemia: When kidneys are diseased or damaged, they do not make enough erythropoietin. As a result, the
levels i calcium and phosphorus in the blood.
9. Renal Osteodystrophy: Renal osteodystrophy is a bone disease that occurs when kidneys fail to maintain proper
10. Urinary tract infections (UTIS): It is an infection that affects part of the urinary tract. Symptoms from a urinary tract
infection include pain with urination, frequent urination and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty
bladder. The most common UTIs occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.

<strong>Uric Acid Kidney Stone:</strong><br>
Stones form when the levels of uric acid in the urine is too high, and/or the urine is too acidic (pH level below 5.5) on a regular basis<br>
&#x2022; More common in men than in women<br>
&#x2022; Occur in people with gout<br><br>

<b>Uric Acid Kidney Stone</b><br>
<b>Symptoms</b><br>
&#x2022; Pain in the lower back sides, abdomen or groin<br>
&#x2022; Blood in the urine<br>
&#x2022; Nausea or vomiting<br>
&#x2022; Fever and chills<br><br>

<b>Treatment</b><br>
&#x2022; Drinking more water<br>
&#x2022; Urinary alkalization: Potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate<br><br>

<strong>Discomfort in Urinary Tract Infections (Burning of Urination)</strong><br>
&#x2022; A burning sensation with urination can be caused by infectious and noninfectious conditions<br>
&#x2022; It also may occur due to decreased pH or acidic urine<br>
&#x2022; Women are more likely to develop than men<br><br>

<b>Symptoms</b><br>
&#x2022; Pain, Burning or Discomfort upon urination<br>
&#x2022; Urinary urgency<br>
&#x2022; Cloudy & Dark urine<br><br>

<b>Treatment</b><br>
&#x2022; Drinking more water <br>
&#x2022; Antibiotics or along with Urinary Alkaliniser <br><br>

<strong>Acidosis (Renal tubular acidosis)</strong><br>
&#x2022; RTA is a disease that occurs when the kidneys fail to excrete acids into the urine<br>
&#x2022; It may be caused by failure to reabsorb bicarbonate ions (Proximal tubule) or by secretion of hydrogen ions (distal tubule)<br><br>

<b>Symptoms</b><br>
&#x2022; Confusion, Fatigue<br>
&#x2022; Increased breathing rate<br>
&#x2022; Kidney stones<br>
&#x2022; Calcium deposited in kidneys<br>
&#x2022; Muscle weakness<br><br>

<b>Treatment</b><br>
&#x2022; Urinary Alkaliniser<br>
&#x2022; Diuretics<br><br>

<strong>&#x2022; Alkaliniser:</strong> <br>
Agent that neutralizes acidity in blood (less acidic).<br>

<strong>&#x2022; Alkalization:</strong><br>
A process that lowers the amount of acid in blood.<br>

<strong>&#x2022; Acidosis:</strong><br>
It refers to an excess of acid in the blood<br>

<strong>&#x2022; Alkalinizing agents:</strong> <br>
Alkalinizing agents are drugs used to manage disorders associated with low pH e.g. Acidosis.<br>

<strong>&#x2022; Uricosuric agents:</strong> <br>
These are substances that increase the excretion of uric acid in the urine. e.g. Allopurinol, Probenecid.<br><br>
