<b>Why Nabuton is Safe?:</b><br>
Nabuton is a prodrug<br>
↓<br>
undergoes hepatic biotransformation to the active component, 6-
methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6MNA), that is a potent inhibitor
of prostaglandin and give anti-inflammatory effect<br>
↓<br>
During excretion through urine it converts into 6-hydroxy-2-
naphthylacetic acid that have no anti-inflammatory property and
do not inhibit prostaglandin (PGI2, PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1alpha)<br><br>

<b>Model Detailing Talk:</b><br>
<div class="a">Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
At your daily practice you get many patients who are suffering from acute and chronic pain. To manage this pain, you always prefer a safe NSAID which can be used for long time with better safety profile especially should be renal safe.</div>

<div class="a">As you already know that NSAID causes decreased glomerular filtration rate and gastric mucus production. So it's really important to choose a NSAID which can be used for long time but safe on gastric and chronic kidney disease. Am I right Sir?</div>

<div class="a">To overcome these problems Navana Pharma offers the renal safe NSAID Nabuton, preparation of Nabumetone 500 and 750 mg Tablet.</div>

<div class="a">Nabuton preferentially inhibits COX-2 thus effectively relief pain and inflammation.On the other hand-<br>
• Nabuton is a non-acidic drug and do not hamper the gastric mucus production thus it is gastric safe NSAID.<br>
• During excretion through kidney Nabuton converts into inactive form thus does not inhibit renal prostaglandin & maintains renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR).</div>

<div class="a">Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
It has been found that Naproxen inhibits renal prostaglandin 65% and decreases GFR 28% whereas Nabuton has no effect on renal prostaglandin or GFR. Nabuton helps to maintain the renal blood flow and GFR. That's why Nabuton is the perfect NSAID for pain management in patient with renal insufficiency.</div>

<div class="a">Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
Nabuton is a non-acidic drug and also have very less effect on COX-1. Thus it can maintain the gastric mucus production. A double blind study was done for 6 months on patient with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It has been found that Nabuton shows 0% perforation, ulceration and bleeding in those patients. So we can say that Nabuton is also a gastric safe NSAID for long term use.</div>

<div class="a">Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
As you know Nabuton is indicated for acute and chronic arthritis related pain management, the starting dose is 1000 mg as a single or divided dose with or without food. Patient with moderate to severe renal insufficiency, dose should be 500 mg to 750 mg.</div>
<div class="a">Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
Finally we can say about Nabuton-<br>
• US-FDA approved NSAID for pain management in Rheumatoid arthritis and Osteoarthritis.<br>
• Ensures gastric safety thus can be taken with or without food.<br>
• Provides renal safety.<br>
• Safe for long-term use (up to 5 years).
</div>

<div class="a">
Considering the above benefits, may I expect at least 3 Rx in favor of our Nabuton? Nabuton is available in nearby shops of your chamber. Thank you Sir/Madam, for giving me your valuable time.</div>
<br>

<b>Short Detail Talk:</b><br>
<div class="a">স্যার, আপনার daily practice এ pain management এর জন্য  NSAID prefer করে থাকেন। কিন্তু NSAID দীর্ঘসময় সেবনের ফলে গ্যাস্ট্রিক সহ কিডনীর বিভিন্ন ধরণের সমস্যার ঝুঁকি বেড়ে যায়। এমতাবস্থায় আপনি একটি Safe NSAID choose করে থাকেন।</div>

<div class="a">Navana Pharma নিয়ে এসেছেন Nabuton, a preparation of Nabumetone যা preferentially Cox-2 কে inhibit করার মাধ্যমে pain & inflammation কমায়। অন্যদিকে Nabuton inactive form এ কিডনি দিয়ে excretion হয়ে থাকে। যেহেতু Nabuton renal prostaglandin কে inhibit করে না তাই glomerular filtration rate maintain করতে সাহায্য করে। এ জন্য renal impaired patient দের safe NSAID হিসেবে confidently prescribe করতে পারবেন।</div>

<div class="a">এছাড়াও ক্লিনিক্যাল ট্রায়ালে দেখা গেছে Nabuton ৫ বছর পর্যন্ত সেবন করা যায়। Nabuton gastric mucus secretion এ কোন hamper করে না বিধায় খাবার আগে ও পরে যে কোন সময় chronic pain এ দেয়া যায় ।</div>
<div class="a">Considering all these benefits, may I expect at least 3 Rx/day.</div>

<b>3. How does Nabuton provide gastric safety?</b><br>
Ans: Nabuton is a non-acidic drug that does not inhibit gastric prostaglandin thus it does not hamper gastric mucus secretion and ensures gastric safety for long term use.<br><br>

<b>4. Is Nabuton safe in pregnancy ?</b><br>
Ans: Pregnancy category of Nabuton is C. That's why it is not recommended in pregnancy but if potential benefit is higher than the risk, physician can prescribe only if clearly needed.<br><br>

<div class="a">Prescribing Information</div>

<div class="a">Composition: Nabuton 500 Tablet: Each film coated tablet contains Nabumetone BP 500 mg. Nabuton 750 Tablet: Each film coated tablet contains Nabumetone BP 750 mg.</div>

<div class="a">Pharmacology: Nabumetone is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties in pharmacological studies. As with other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, it's mode of action is not known; however, the ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis may be involved in the anti-inflammatory effect. The active ingredient is a prodrug, which undergoes hepatic biotransformation to the active component.
6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6MNA), that is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis.</div>

<div class="a">Indication: Nabuton tablet is indicated for acute and chronic treatment
of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.</div>

<div class="a">Dose & Administration: Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid arthritis: The recommended starting dose is 1000 mg taken as a single dose with or without food. Some patients may obtain more symptomatic relief from 1500 mg to 2000 mg per day. Nabumetone can be given in either a single or twice-daily dose. Dosage greater than 2000 mg per day have not been studied. The lowest effective dose should be used for chronic treatment. Caution should be used in prescribing Nabumetone to patient with moderate or severe renal insufficiency. The maximum starting dose of Nabumetone in patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency should not exceed 750 mg or 500 mg, respectively once daily. Following careful monitoring of renal function in patients with
moderate or severe renal insufficiency, daily doses may be increased to a maximum of 1500 mg and 1000 mg, respectively or as directed by the physicians.</div>

<div class="a">Contraindication: Hypersensitivity NSAID induced asthma, urticaria or other allergic type reactions.</div>

<div class="a">Warning & Precaution: As a class, NSAIDs have been associated with renal papillary necrosis and other abnormal renal pathology during long-term administration to animals. A second form of renal toxicity often associated with NSAIDS is seen in patients with conditions leading to a reduction in renal blood flow or blood volume, where renal prostaglandins have a supportive role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of NSAID results in a dose dependent decrease in prostaglandin synthesis and secondarily, in a reduction of renal blood flow, which may participate over renal decomposition. Patients at greater risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and the elderly patient. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is typically followed by recovery to pretreatment state.</div>

<div class="a">Side Effects: The common side effects of NSAIDs are- diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, constipation, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, gastritis, stomatitis,
dizziness, headache, fatigue, increased sweating, insomnia, pruritus, rash, tinnitus.</div>

<div class="a">Use in Pregnancy & Lactation: Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Thus drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because of known effect of prostaglandin-synthesis-inhibiting drugs on the human fetal cardiovascular system use of Nabumetone during the third trimester of pregnancy is not recommended. Nabumetone is not recommended for use in nursing mothers because of the possible adverse effects of prostaglandin-synthesis-inhibiting drugs on neonates.</div>

<div class="a">Use in Children & Adolescents: Use in Children & Adolescents is not recommended.</div> 

<div class="a">Drug Interactions: In vitro studies have shown that, because of its affinity for protein. 6MNA may displace other protein-bound drugs from their binding site. Caution should be exercised when administering Nabumetone with warfarin since interactions have been seen with other NSAIDS.</div>

<div class="a">Overdosage: Symptoms of NSAIDs overdoses are usually limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression and coma may occur.</div>

<div class="a">Storage: Store below 30°C. away from light and in a dry place. Keep out of the reach of children.</div>

<div class="a">Packing: Nabuton 500 Tablet: Each box contains 3 X 10 tablets in Alu-Alu blister pack with an insert. Nabuton 750 Tablet: Each box contains 4 X 6 tablets in Alu-Alu blister pack with an insert.</div>
