<strong>Heart:</strong><br>
A hollow, muscular organ, the central pumping station Circulation of blood throughout the body through blood vessels<br>
Layers of heart muscles<br>
Epicardium<br>
Myocardium<br>
Endocardium<br>
Total heart is covered by Pericardium<br><br>

<strong>Valves of the heart</strong><br>
4 Types<br>
Tricuspid Valve<br>
Pulmonary Valve<br>
Mitral Valve<br>
Aortic Valve<br><br>

<strong>Artery& Vein:</strong><br>
Artery: <br>
Arteries are the vessels that carry oxygenated blood away from heart to the different parts of body<br>
Vein: <br>
Veins are the vessels that carries non-oxygenated blood from the different parts of body to the heart<br>
Capillary : <br>
Capillaries are mint dvessels that join artery and vein<br><br>

<strong>Atherosclerosis:</strong><br>
Deposition of fatty substance inside the blood
vessels<br><br>

<strong>lschemia:</strong><br>
Decreased blood flow to an organ, usually due to constriction or obstruction of an artery.<br><br>

<strong>Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD):</strong><br>
Narrowing of the coronary arteries and decreased blood flow to the heart<br><br>

<strong>Angina Pectoris:</strong><br>
Angina Pectoris Angina is chest pain or discomfort caused when your heart muscle doesn’t get enough oxygen-rich blood.<br><br>

<strong>Myocardial Infarction (Ml):</strong><br>
Myocardial necrosis resulting from an insufficient supply of oxygenated blood to an area of the heart. Myocardial Infarction is also known as Heart Attack.<br><br>

<strong>Congestive Heart Failure (CHF):</strong><br>
Failure of the heart to pump adequate blood to meet the body requirements<br><br>

<strong>Coronary Artery Diseases (CAD):</strong><br>
A narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. The condition results from a buildup of plaque and greatly increases the risk of a heart attack.<br><br>

<strong>Left Ventricular Hypertrophy(LVH):</strong><br>
Thickening of the myocardium(muscle) of the Left ventricle of heart.<br><br>

<strong>Arrythmia:</strong><br>
An abnormal/irregular heartbeat<br>
Tachycardia (>l00bpm)<br>
Bradycardia (<60 bpm)<br><br>

<strong>Vasoconstriction:</strong><br>
Narrowing of the blood vessels that results from contraction of the muscular walls of the vessels.<br><br>

<strong>Vasodilation:</strong><br>
Widening of blood vessels that results from relaxation of the muscular walls of the vessels.<br><br>

<strong>Stroke:</strong><br>
The sudden death of brain cells due to lack of oxygen, caused by blockage of blood flow or rupture of an artery to the brain.<br><br>

<strong>Blood Pressure:</strong><br>
Lateral pressure of blood on the walls of the blood vessels when flowing through it.<br><br>

<strong>Blood Pressure is two types:</strong><br>
1. Systolic Pressure: <br>
It is the maximum pressure of blood while ventricles are contract. Normal value of SBP is l2OmmHg.<br>
2. Diastolic Pressure: <br>
It is the minimum pressure of blood while ventricles are relax. Normal value of DBP is 8OmmHg.<br><br>

BP= CO × PR<br>
Cardiac Output × Peripheral Resistance<br><br>

<strong>Cardiac output:</strong><br>
The volume of blood ejected from heart/minute is called Cardiac output<br><br>

Co= HR × SV<br><br>

<strong>Peripheral resistance:</strong><br>
Peripheral resistance is the resistance the arteries to blood flow. As the arteries constrict, the resistance increases and as they dilate, resistance decreases<br><br>

<strong>HR</strong><br>
The number of times the heart beats in one minute is called HR<br><br>

<strong>SV</strong><br>
Amount of blood pumped Out from the left ventricle per beat is called SV<br><br>

<b>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</b><br>
<b>1. Why is Tabis (Bisoprolol) suitable for Asthmatic hypertensive patients?</b><br>
Ans: Beta 2 receptor located in Lung which is responsible for bronchial vasodilation. Tabis (Bisoprolol) is highly selective
to Beta 1 receptor thus it does not hamper the function of Beta 2 receptor in lung. That's why Tabis (Bisoprolol) is suitable for asthmatic hypertensive patients.<br>

<b>2. Why is Tabis suitable drug for smoker hypertensive patients?</b><br>
Ans: Smoking increases the release of epinephrine and it stimulates the activity of Beta 1 receptor which is responsible for increasing heart rate and blood pressure. Tabis is highly selective beta 1 blocker which works in heart and kidney and
blocks the activity of Beta 1 receptor to control blood pressure.
<br>
<b>3. Why is Tabis (Bisoprolol) better than Atenolol in smoker hypertensive patients?</b><br>
Ans: Tabis (Bisoprolol) and Atenolol both are beta 1 blocker but Tabis is highly & more selective (19 Fold) than Atenolol (5 Fold) to beta 1 receptor (located in heart and kidney) which blocks the activity of Beta 1 receptor thus effectively
control BP of smoker hypertensive patients more than Atenolol.<br>

<b>4. Why is Tabis (Bisoprolol) better than Metoprolol in smoker hypertensive patients?</b><br>
Ans: Tabis (Bisoprolol) and Metoprolol both are beta 1 blocker but Tabis is highly & more selective (19 Fold) than Metoprolol (6 Fold) to beta 1 receptor (located in heart and kidney) which blocks the activity of Beta 1 receptor thus
effectively control BP of smoker hypertensive patients more than Metoprolol.<br>
