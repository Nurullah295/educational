<strong>Male Reproductive System:</strong><br>
The male reproductive system consists of a number of sex organs, most of the male reproductive system is located outside of the body. These external structures include the penis, scrotum, and testicles.<br><br>

External genital organs:<br>
• Penis<br>
• Scrotum<br>

Internal genital organs:<br>
• Testis<br>
• Epididymis<br>
• Vas deferens<br>
• Accessory glands<br>
- seminal vesicles<br>
- the prostate gland<br>
- the bulbourethral glands (Cowper glands).<br><br>

Male Sex hormones:<br>
Testosterone<br>
Luteinizing hormone<br>
Estrogens<br>
Growth hormone<br><br>

<strong>Internal Structures<br>

Epididymis:</strong><br>
• This is a tightly coiled tube that is responsible for conducting the sperm from the tubule to the vas deferens.<br>
• It has a length of approximately 20 feet long.<br>
• Some sperm are stored in the epididymis, along with the semen.<br>
• The sperm takes an estimated 12 to 20 days of travel along the epididymis, and a total of 64 days to reach maturity.<br><br>
 
<strong>Vas Deferens:</strong><br>
• The function of the vas deferens is to carry the sperm through the inguinal canal from the epididymis into the abdominal cavity where it will end at the seminal vesicles and the ejaculatory duct.<br>
• It is a hollow tube that is protected by a thick fibrous coating and surrounded by arteries and veins.<br><br>
 
<strong>Seminal Vesicles:</strong><br>
• These are two convoluted pouches along the lower portion of the posterior surface of the bladder.<br>
• The seminal vesicles secrete a liquid that is viscous and alkaline and has high protein, sugar, and prostaglandin content, which makes the sperm increasingly motile.<br><br>
 
<strong>Ejaculatory Ductss:</strong><br>
• These ducts pass through the prostate gland to join the seminal vesicles and the urethra.<br><br>
 
<strong>Prostate Gland:</strong><br>
• This is a chestnut-sized gland that is situated below the bladder.<br>
• It secretes a thin, alkaline fluid that adds protection to the sperm from being immobilized by the low pH level of the urethra.<br>
• The urethra passes through its center like a doughnut.<br><br>
 
<strong>Bulbourethral Glands:</strong><br>
• Also called as Cowper’s gland, these glands also secrete alkaline fluid to counteract the acidic environment in the urethra.<br>
• These are twp glands located at either side of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles and empty through the short ducts towards the urethra.<br>
• Semen is a product of 60% from the prostate gland, 30% from the seminal vesicles, 5% from the epididymis, and 5% from the bulbourethral glands.<br><br>
 
<strong>Urethra:</strong><br>
• This structure passes through the prostate gland towards the shaft and glans penis.<br>
• It is a hollow tube from the base of the bladder and lined with mucous membrane.<br>
• It has a length of approximately 8 inches or 18 to 20 cm.<br><br>
 
<strong>External Structures<br>
Scrotum:</strong><br>
• The scrotum is responsible for the support of the testes and it regulates the temperature of the sperm.<br>
• It is a rugated, muscular, skin-covered pouch over the perineum.<br>
• To promote the production and viability of the sperm, the scrotum contracts towards the body during a very cold weather and relaxes away from the body during a hot weather.<br><br>
 
<strong>Testes:</strong><br>
• In each scrotum lies two oval-shaped glands called the testes.<br>
• These are 2 to 3 cm in width and are encapsulated in a protective, white fibrous capsule.<br>
• Several lobules are contained in each testis, which also contains Leydig’s cells that produce testosterone and seminiferous tubules that produce spermatozoa.<br>
• In most men, one testis is slightly lower than the other to prevent trauma and easily sit or do any muscular activity.<br><br>
 
<strong>Penis:</strong><br>
• The penis has three parts: two are called the corpus cavernosa, and the other is the corpus spongiosum.<br>
• These erectile tissues also contain the urethra, making the penis an outlet for both urinary and reproductive<br><br>
 
<strong>functions:</strong><br>
• Erection of the penis is stimulated by the parasympathetic nerve innervations, and the blood supply for the penis is from the penile artery.<br>
• The glans, a sensitive, bulging ridge of tissue, is located at the distal part of the penis.<br>
• The prepuce, which is a retractable casing of skin, protects the glans at birth. It is also the part that is surgically removed during circumcision<br><br>

<strong>Female Reproductive System:</strong><br>
The principal organs of Female Reproductive System are:<br>
Ovaries<br>
Fallopian Tubes<br>
Uterus<br>
Vagina<br><br>

<strong>Internal Structures<br>
Ovaries</strong><br>
• The ovaries are the ultimate life-maker for the females.<br>
• For its physical structure, it has an estimated length of 4 cm and width of 2 cm and is 1.5 cm thick. It appears to be shaped like an almond. It looks pitted, like a raisin, but is grayish white in color.<br>

• It is located proximal to both sides of the uterus at the lower abdomen.<br>

• For its function, the ovaries produce, mature, and discharge the egg cells or ova.<br>

• Ovarian function is for the maturation and maintenance of the secondary sex characteristics in females.<br>

• It also has three divisions: the protective layer of epithelium, the cortex, and the central medulla.<br><br>
<br>

<br>
<strong>Fallopian Tubes:</strong><br>
• The fallopian tubes serve as the pathway of the egg cells towards the uterus.<br>
• It is a smooth, hollow tunnel that is divided into four parts: <br>
the interstitial, which is 1 cm in length; the isthmus, which is2 cm in length;<br> 
the ampulla, which is 5 cm in length; and the infundibular, which is 2 cm long and shaped like a funnel.<br>
• The funnel has small hairs called the fimbria that propel the ovum into the fallopian tube.<br>
• The fallopian tube is lined with mucous membrane, and underneath is the connective tissue and the muscle layer.<br>
• The muscle layer is responsible for the peristaltic movements that propel the ovum forward.<br>
• The distal ends of the fallopian tubes are open, making a pathway for conception to occur.<br><br>
 
<strong>Uterus:</strong><br>
• The uterus is described as a hollow, muscular, pear-shaped organ.<br>
• It is located at the lower pelvis, which is posterior to the bladder and anterior to the rectum.<br>
• The uterus has an estimated length of 5 to 7 cm and width of 5 cm. it is 2.5 cm deep in its widest part.<br>
• For non-pregnant women, it is approximately 60g in weight.<br>
• Its function is to receive the ovum from the fallopian tube and provide a place for implantation and nourishment.<br>
• It also gives protection for the growing fetus.<br>
• It is divided into three: the body, the isthmus, and the cervix.<br>
• The body forms the bulk of the uterus, being the uppermost part. This is also the part that expands to accommodate the growing fetus.<br>
• The isthmus is just a short connection between the body and the cervix. This is the portion that is cut during a cesarean section.<br>
• The cervix lies halfway above the vagina, and the other half extends into the vagina. It has an internal and external cervical os, which is the opening into the cervical canal.<br><br>

<br>
<strong>External Structures<br>
Mons Veneris:</strong><br>
• The mons veneris is a pad of fat tissues over the symphysis pubis.<br>
• It has a covering of coarse, curly hairs, the pubic hair.<br>
• It protects the pubic bone from trauma.<br><br>
 
<strong>Labia Minora:</strong><br>
• The labia minora is a spread of two connective tissue folds that are pinkish in color.<br>
• The internal surface is composed of mucous membrane and the external surface is skin.<br>
• It contains sebaceous glands all over the area.<br><br>
 
<strong>Labia Majora:</strong><br>
• Lateral to the labia minora are two folds of fat tissue covered by loose connective tissue and epithelium, the labia majora.<br>
• Its function is to protect the external genitalia and the distal urethra and vagina from trauma.<br>
• It is covered in pubic hair that serves as additional protection against harmful bacteria that may enter the structure.<br><br>
 
<strong>Vestibule:</strong><br>
• It is a smooth, flattened surface inside the labia where in the openings to the urethra and the vagina arise.<br><br>

<strong>Clitoris:</strong><br>
• The clitoris is a small, circular organ of erectile tissue at the front of the labia minora.<br>
• The prepuce, a fold of skin, serves as its covering.<br>
• This is the center for sexual arousal and pleasure for females because it is highly sensitive to touch and temperature.<br><br>
 
<strong>Skene’s Glands:</strong><br>
• Also called as paraurethral glands, they are found lateral to the urethral meatus and have ducts that open into the urethra.<br>
• The secretions from this gland lubricate the external genitalia during coitus.<br><br>
 
<strong>Bartholin’s Gland:</strong><br>
• Also called bulbovaginal gland, this is another gland responsible for the lubrication of the external genitalia during coitus.<br>
• It has ducts that open into the distal vagina.<br>
• Both of these glands secretions are alkaline to help the sperm survive in the vagina.<br><br>
 
<strong>Fourchette:</strong><br>
• This is a ridge of tissue which is formed by the posterior joining of the labia minora and majora.<br>
• During episiotomy, this is the tissue that is cut to enlarge the vaginal opening.<br><br>
 
<strong>Perineal Body:</strong><br>
• This is a muscular area that stretches easily during childbirth.<br>
• Most pregnancy exercises such as Kegel’s and squatting are done to strengthen the perineal body to allow easier expansion during childbirth and avoid tearing the tissue.<br><br>
 
<strong>Hymen:</strong><br>
• This covers the opening of the vagina.<br>
• It is tough, elastic, semicircle tissue torn during the first sexual intercourse.<br><br>

<b>(Vagina:</b><br>
The vagina is a muscular canal that extends from the vulva to the neck of the uterus (cervix). The vagina is where the lining of the uterus is shed during menstruation, where penetration can occur during sex and where a baby descends during childbirth.<br><br>

<b>The vulva:</b><br>
The vulva is the outer part of the female genitals. The vulva includes the opening of the vagina (sometimes called the vestibule), the labia majora (outer lips), the labia minora (inner lips), and the clitoris.)<br><br>
