<b>1. Acute Constipation:</b><br>
Acute constipation usually has an organic cause such as medication or a medical condition.
<br>
<b>2. Chronic Constipation:</b><br>
Chronic constipation is symptom-based including fewer than 3 stools per week. Stool form is
mostly hard or lumpy and difficult stool passage for more than 6 months.
<br>
<b>3. Chronic Idiopathic Constipation:</b><br>
If the specific cause of chronic constipation is unknown, it is called Chronic Idiopathic
Constipation (CIC).
<br>
<b>4. Constipation:</b><br>
Constipation occurs when bowel movements become less frequent and stools become difficult to pass.
<br>
<b>5. Erosive Esophagitis:</b><br>
Erosive Esophagitis is characterized by erosion or inflammation in the esophagus due to
excessive reflux of gastric acid.
<br>
<b>6. Esophagitis:</b><br>
Esophagitis is an inflammation of the lining of the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the throat
to the stomach. If left untreated, this condition can become very uncomfortable, causing problems with swallowing,
ulcers, and scarring of the esophagus.
<br>
<b>7. Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD):</b><br>
The backward flow of the gastric acid of the stomach into the esophagus
that is due to malfunctioning of sphincter at the lower end of the esophagus.
<br>
<b>8. Gastroesophageal reflux disease:</b><br>
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is defined as chronic symptoms or mucosal
damage produced by the abnormal reflux of stomach acid to the esophagus. A typical symptom is heartburn.
<br>
<b>9. Hyperacidity:</b><br>
When there is an excess amount of gastric acid (hydrochloric acid) production in the stomach, this
condition is known as Hyperacidity.
<br>
<b>10. Peptic Ulcer:</b><br>
Painful sore in the lining of the stomach or duodenum resulting from digestive action of gastric acid (HCI)
in the mucous membrane and from infection.
<br>
<b>11. Triple Therapy:</b><br>
Triple therapy (TT) consists of proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), clarithromycin and amoxicillin has been
considered as standard first-line treatment for H. pylori eradication to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence.
<br>
<b>12. Typhoid fever:</b><br>
It is a bacterial infection that can lead to a high fever, diarrhoea and vomiting. It is caused by the
bacteria Salmonella typhi. The infection is often passed on through contaminated food and drinking water.
<br>
<b>13. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome:</b><br>
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is a rare condition in which one or more tumors for more
pancreas or duodenum that secrete large amount of hormone gastrin, which causes the stomach to produce more
acid, resulting in peptic ulcers.


<strong>Peptic ulcers:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Peptic ulcers are sores that develop in the lining of the stomach, lower esophagus or 1st portion of small intestine.<br>
&#x2022; Caused by<br>
-Infection from Helicobacterpylori<br>
-Erosion from stomach acids<br>
-Use of NSAIDs<br>
&#x2022; There are 3 types of peptic ulcers:<br>
1. Gastric Ulcer: <br>
develop inside the stomach.<br>
2. Esophageal Ulcer: <br>
develop inside the esophagus<br>
3. Duodenal ulcers: <br>
develop inside the duodenum<br><br>

<strong>Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD):</strong><br>
&#x2022; It occurs when acidic liquid content of the stomach frequently flow back into the esophagus<br>
&#x2022; It is also called <span>Acid Reflux</span> (symptom have more than twice a week)<br>
&#x2022; Common symptom of GERD is persistent <span>Heartburn</span><br>
Types-<br>
1. Non-Erosive Reflux Disease (NERD): <br>
is one of the subcategory of GERD (symptoms of mucosal erosions is absented at endoscopy)<br>
2. Erosive Esophagitis (EE):<br>
causes inflammation, erosions and ulcers in esophagus<br><br>

<strong>Esophagitis:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Esophagitis Is any inflammation, irritation or swelling of the lining of esophagus<br>
&#x2022; Common signs and symptoms include: <br>
Painful swallowing, Chest pain occurs with eating, Acid reflux, Heartburn etc.<br>
&#x2022; There are several types of esophagitis include: <br>
Reflux esophagitis(GERD), Infectious esophagitis, Drug-induced esophagitis, Eosinophilic esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, Radiation-induced esophagitis etc.<br><br>

<strong>NSAIDs -induced Ulcer:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Higher doses of NSAIDs that are used for a long period of time for
chronic pain<br>
&#x2022; Second cause of peptic ulcer<br>
&#x2022; Can caused by the damage of gastric mucosa, suppression of gastric
prostaglandin synthesis, reduction of gastric mucosal blood flow etc.<br><br>


<strong>Helicobacter pylory -induced infection:</strong><br>
&#x2022; H. pylory occurs when this bacteria infect stomach<br>
&#x2022; It attacks mucus lining of stomach and causing ulcers<br>
&#x2022; It is a common cause of peptic ulcers<br>
&#x2022; Antiulcerant with antimicrobial therapy can be needed to cure this infection<br><br>

<strong>Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome:</strong><br>
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is a rare digestive disorder in which one or
more tumors form in pancreas or duodenum. These tumors secrete large amounts of the hormone Gastrin, which causes stomach to produce too
much acid. The excess acid then leads to ulcers.<br><br>
