<strong>What causes edema?</strong><br>
<span>&#x261E;</span> Edema is caused by extra fluid that builds up in the tissues of
your body. Many things can cause fluid to buiLd up. Sitting or
standing still for too tong can cause edema of the Legs, especially in hot weather. Eating food with too much salt can
make the problem worse. Edema can also be a side effect of
taking certain medicines. Some health probLems, such as congestive heart failure, liver disease, and kidney disease, can cause edema. You cannot catch edema from other people. It does not run in families.
