<b>Bangla short detailing:</b><br>
Dear sir/ Madam<br>
Good Morning/Evening<br>

In your daily practice, you are giving treatment to many diabetic patients, তাদের
জন্য আপনি first line drug হিসাবে Metformin অথবা step 2 therapy হিসাবে Insulin,
Sulfonylurea prescribe করে থাকেন. Metformin, Sulfonylurea and Insulin বহুল
ব্যবহৃত drug হলেও hypoglycemia and weight gain এর পাশাপাশি long time ধরে
ব্যবহার করার ফলে effectiveness কমে যায়, এর কারণে patients compliance very
poor.<br>
এই সমস্যা বিবেচনা করে Navana Pharma has Launched Aloglip যা Alogliptin 6.25,
12.5 and 25mg এর preparations. Alogliptin is newly developed DPP-4 inhibitor
Approved by USFDA and EMA. Alogliptin almost 100% DPP-4 কে inhibit করার
মাধ্যমে diabetic কন্ট্রোল করে থাকে.<br>
Alogliptin GLP-1 and GIP (Incretin or natural hormone) যা beta cell কে preserve and
protect করার মাধ্যমে pancreas থেকে insulin secretion বাড়ায় , Liver থেকে
glucagon secretion কমায় এবং GI tract এ gastric emptying টাইম delay করে, ফলে
stomach এর মুভমেন্ট কমে যায় এছাড়াও BRAIN থেকে appitite suppress করে এবং
insulin এর sensitivity বাড়ানোর মাধ্যমে Peripheral glucose uptake বাড়ায় ফলে
diabetic controlled হয়.<br>
Alogliptin 100% bioavaiability ensure করছে এবং এর half-life 21 hr. দুটি separate
comperative study থেকে দেখা যাচ্ছে Alogliptin HbA1c -0.6% এবং FPG -16mg/dl ও
Linagliptin HbA1c -0.4% এবং FPG –8.5mg/dl reducess করছে, যা clinically and
statistically Linagliptin এর থেকে better efficacy show করছে . Alogliptin world এর
developed country গুলো যেমন (United states, Europe, Australia, China, Japan,
south Korea and Mexico) তে confidently prescribe হয়ে আসছে.<br>
Sir/Madam:<br>
Considering all benefits, may I expect 2 Rx daily in favour of Aloglip?<br>
Thank you Sir/ Madam.<br><br>

<div class="HL1">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):</div>

<div class="FQ">1. What is Aloglip (Alogliptin)?:</div>

Ans: Aloglip (Alogliptin) is a prescription medicine used along with diet and exercise to control blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes.<br>

<div class="FQ">2. What is the dose of Aloglip for patients with renal or hepatic impairment?:</div>

Ans: In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to 60 mL/min), the recommended dosage is 12.5 mg once daily. In patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (CrCl less than 30 mL/min) the recommended dosage is 6.25 mg once daily.<br>

<div class="FQ">3. What is the Bioavailability & Half-life of Alogliptin?:</div>

Ans: Bioavailability is 100% & Half-life is 21 hr.<br>

<div class="FQ">4. What is the function of incretin & role of Alogliptin?:</div>

Ans: Incretin hormone like (GLP-1, GIP) shows better function in multiple body organ system. In PANCREAS, stimulates insulin secretion and inhibits glucagon production. In LIVER, inhibits pancreatic glucagon secretion, causing reduced hepatic glucose production. In GI TRACT, Delays gastric emptying & In BRAIN, suppresses appetite, resulting in decreased energy intake and subsequent weight loss. Improved insulin sensitivity via weight loss may lead to improved peripheral glucose uptake. DPP-4 enzyme rapidly degrades incretins. Alogliptin offers almost 100% DPP-4 inhibition & increases active incretins.<br>

<div class="FQ">5. Why is Alogliptin better than Linagliptin?:</div>

Ans: Alogliptin reduces HbA1c almost -0.6% whereas Linagliptin reduces HbA1c just -0.4% & Alogliptin reduces FPG almost-16mg/dl whereas Linagliptin reduces FPG just -8.5mg/dl, almost double. This results in significant improvement in HbA1c & FPG compared to Linagliptin.<br>

<div class="FQ">6. Which one is better for DPP-4 inhibition?:</div>

Ans: Linagliptin provides only 80% DPP inhibition whereas Alogliptin offers almost 100% DPP-4 inhibition. Which is more than Linagliptin. This ensures optimum diabetes control.<br>

<div class="FQ">7. What is pregnancy category of Alogliptin?:</div>

Ans: Pregnancy Category is B.

<div class="FQ">8. Bioavaiability of Aloglip?:</div>
Ans: Bioavaiability of Aloglip 100% and Linagliptin offers only 30%<br>

<div class="FQ">9. Half-life of Aloglip?:</div>
Ans: Half-life of Aloglip 21 hrs and Linagliptin offers only 12 hrs<br>

<div class="FQ">8. Time to peak Plasma concentration of Aloglip?:</div>
Ans: Time to peak Plasma concentration of Aloglip 1-2 hr and Linagliptin offers 1.5 hr

<div class="PI"> Pharmacology:</div>

Increased concentrations of the incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released into the bloodstream form the small intestine in response to meals. These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzyme tithing minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved. Alogliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin selectively binds to and inhibits DPP-4 but not DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating therapeutic exposures.<br> 


<div class="PI"> Indication:</div>

Aloglip (Alogliptin) is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
