<b class="HL"> Indications:</b><br>
Olopatadin eye drops is indicated for the treatment of signs and symptoms (itchy, watery, red and swollen eyes and/or eyelids) of allergic conjunctivitis including vernal keratoconjunctivitis, vernal keratitis, blepharitis, blepharoconjunctivitis and giant papillary conjunctivitis.
<br><br>

<b class="HL"> Pharmacology:</b><br>
Olopatadine, an antihistamine, works by blocking the action of histamine in the body, which reduces allergy symptoms. Olopatadine hydrochloride treats sneezing, itching, runny nose, and other nasal symptoms of allergies.
<br>
<li> Mode of Action:<br>
     Olopatadine is an anti-allergic molecule that works via several mechanisms. As a mast cell stabilizer, it stabilizes rodent basophils and human conjunctival mast cells and inhibits the immunologically-stimulated release of histamine. Olopatadine acts as an antagonist at the histamine H1 receptors with high selectivity, Upon binding, olopatadine blocks the H1 receptor signaling pathway, inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators, such as tryptase, prostaglandin D2, TNF-alpha, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines.
</li>
<li> Pharmacokinetics:<br>
     Absorption: Olopatadine was absorbed with individual peak plasma concentrations observed between 30 minutes and 1 hour after twice daily intranasal administration of Olopatadine Nasal Spray. Distribution: The protein binding of olopatadine was moderate at approximately 55% in human serum, and independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.1 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism: Olopatadine is not extensively metabolized. Based on plasma metabolite profiles of olopatadine, at least six minor metabolites circulate in human plasma. Elimination: The plasma elimination half-life of olopatadine is 8 to 12 hours. Olopatadine is mainly eliminated through urinary excretion
</li>
<b class="HL"> Dosage:</b><br>
Adult Dose:<br>
<li> 0.1%: One drop in each affected eye two times per day at an interval of 6 to 8 hours.</li>
    <li> 0.2%: One drop in the affected eye once a day.</li>
    Child Dose of  0.2%:<br>
Children(Above 2 years of age) one drop in each affected eye once a day.
<br><br>

<b class="HL"> Interaction:</b><br>
Formal drug-drug interaction studies were not conducted for Alleloc DS Nasal Spray. Drug interactions with inhibitors of liver enzymes are not anticipated because olopatadine is eliminated predominantly by renal excretion. Drug interactions involving P450 inhibition and plasma protein binding are also not expected.
<br><br>

<b class="HL"> Pregnancy & Lactation:</b><br>
Olopatadine was found not to be teratogenic in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used in pregnant women only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether topical ocular administration could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in the human breast milk. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when Olopatadine is administered to a nursing mother.
<br><br>
