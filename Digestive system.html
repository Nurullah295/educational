    </div>
<strong>*Definition of digestive system:</strong><br>
The bodily system concerned with the ingestion, digestion, and absorption of food<br><br> and the discharge of residual wastes and consisting of the digestive tract and accessory glands (such as the salivary glands and the pancreas) that secrete digestive enzymes<br><br>

Digestive juices:<br>
The juices which are secreted by the various glands to help in the digestion process are called as digestive juices.<br>
Mouth - saliva.<br>
Stomach - pepsin, renin, hydrochloric acid.<br>
Small intestine - Colipase, bile salts.<br>
Pancreas - trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, elastase, carboxypeptidase, pancreatic lipase, nucleases, and amylase.<br>
Liver - Bile acids.<br><br>


<strong>*Function of digestive system:</strong><br>
&#x2022; *1. Ingestion:<br>
It means when food enters in the Digestive track via the mouth.<br>

&#x2022; 2. Propulsion:<br>
Propulsion is the movement of food along the digestive tract. The major means of propulsion is peristalsis, a series of alternating contractions and relaxations of smooth muscle that lines the walls of the digestive organs and that forces food to move forward.<br> 

&#x2022; *3. Secretion:<br>
Secretion of digestive enzymes and other substances liquefies, adjusts the pH of, and chemically breaks down the food.<br>

&#x2022; *4. Mechanical digestion:<br>
Breaking down food into smaller pieces. Mechanical digestion starts in the mouth, with the physical processing of food by the teeth, and continues in the stomach.<br> 

&#x2022; 5. Chemical digestion:<br> 
Chemical digestion starts with the release of enzymes in saliva, and continues in the stomach and intestines.<br>

&#x2022; *6. Absorption:<br>
During absorption, the nutrients that come from food pass through the wall of the small intestine and into the bloodstream.<br>

&#x2022; 7. Defecation:<br>
Defecation is the elimination of indigestible residues from the GI tract via the anus in the form of feces.<br><br>

Note:<br>
Mastication: The process of mechanical breakdown by the teeth; also known as chewing.<br>
Bolus: Moistened and mechanically manipulated food.<br>

<strong>Mouth:</strong><br>
The mouth, or oral cavity, is the first part of the digestive tract. Food enters the digestive tract through the mouth, or oral cavity, a mucous membrane-lined cavity.<br><br>

&#x2022; Lips: The lips (labia) protect its anterior opening.<br>
&#x2022; Cheeks: The cheeks form its lateral walls.<br>
&#x2022; Palate: The hard palate forms its anterior roof, and the soft palate forms its posterior roof. It separates the oral cavity from the nasal cavity. <br>
&#x2022; Uvula: The uvula is a fleshy finger-like projection of the soft palate, which extends inferiorly from the posterior edge of the soft palate.<br>
&#x2022; Vestibule: The space between the lips and the cheeks externally and the teeth and gums internally is the vestibule.<br>
&#x2022; Oral cavity proper: The area contained by the teeth is the oral cavity proper.<br>
&#x2022; Tongue: The muscular tongue occupies the floor of the mouth and has several bony attachments- two of these are to the hyoid bone and the styloid processes of the skull. The tongue manipulates food in the mouth and is used in speech. The surface is covered with papillae that provide friction and contain the taste buds<br>
&#x2022; Teeth: A complete set of deciduous (primary) teeth contains 20 teeth. There are 32 teeth in a complete permanent (secondary) set. The shape of each tooth type corresponds to the way it handles food.<br>
&#x2022; Lingual frenulum: The lingual frenulum, a fold of mucous membrane, secures the tongue to the floor of the mouth and limits its posterior movements.<br>
&#x2022; Palatine tonsils: At the posterior end of the oral cavity are paired masses of lymphatic tissue, the palatine tonsils.<br>
&#x2022; Lingual tonsil: The lingual tonsils cover the base of the tongue just beyond.<br><br>

<strong>Pharynx:</strong><br>
The pharynx (throat) is the transition area from the mouth to the esophagus.<br>
The pharynx is a muscular structure lined with mucous membrane. From the mouth, food passes posteriorly into the oropharynx and laryngopharynx.<br>
The pharynx consists of three main divisions.<br>
(&#x2022; Nasopharynx:<br>
The nasopharynx, located behind the nasal cavities; The nasal pharynx connects to the second region, the oral pharynx, by means of a passage called an isthmus.)<br>
&#x2022; Oropharynx:<br>
The oropharynx is posterior to the oral cavity.<br>
&#x2022; Laryngopharynx(hypopharynx):<br>
Which begins at the epiglottis and leads down to the esophagus; both of which are common passageways for food, fluids, and air.<br><br>

<strong>*Esophagus:</strong><br>
The esophagus or gullet, is a collapsible muscular tube about ten inches (25 cm) long extending from the hypopharynx to the stomach.<br>
• Size and function. About 25 cm (10 inches) long, it is essentially a passageway that conducts food by peristalsis to the stomach.<br>
• Structure. The walls of the alimentary canal organs from the esophagus to the large intestine are made up of the same four basic tissue layers or tunics.<br>
• Mucosa. The mucosa is the innermost layer, a moist membrane that lines the cavity, or lumen, of the organ; it consists primarily of a surface epithelium, plus a small amount of connective tissue (lamina propria) and a scanty smooth muscle layer.<br>
• Submucosa. The submucosa is found just beneath the mucosa; it is a soft connective tissue layer containing blood vessels, nerve endings, lymph nodules, and lymphatic vessels.<br>
• Muscularis externa. The muscularis externa is a muscle layer typically made up of an inner circular layer and an outer longitudinal layer of smooth muscle cells.<br>
• Serosa. The serosa is the outermost layer of the wall that consists of a single layer of flat serous fluid-producing cells, the visceral peritoneum.<br>
• Intrinsic nerve plexuses. The alimentary canal wall contains two important intrinsic nerve plexuses- the submucosal nerve plexus and the myenteric nerve plexus, both of which are networks of nerve fibers that are actually part of the autonomic nervous system and help regulate the mobility and secretory activity of the GI tract organs.<br><br>

<strong>*Stomach:</strong><br>
The stomach is a muscular, hollow organ in the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
 
• Location. The C-shaped stomach is on the left side of the abdominal cavity, nearly hidden by the liver and the diaphragm.<br>
• Capacity: Neunate- 30ml, Adult- 1.5L.<br><br>

*Function:<br>
1. Temporary storage organ: It acts as a temporary storage organ for food(4-6 hrs).<br>
2. mixing and breakdown of food by contraction and relaxation of the muscle layers in the stomach<br>
3. digestion of food<br>
4. Secretory function: It secretes HCl and pepsin apart from other things including mucus. The G cells of pyloric region secrete gastrin hormone which is one of the GI tract hormones.<br>
5. Digestive function is because of pepsin enzyme. It is a proteolytic enzyme. Pepsin helps to breakdown the protein. <br>
6. Protective function is because of high acidic medium due to presence of HCl, many of the micro­organisms die. Thereby it protects the GI tract from getting invaded by the microorganisms.<br>
7. Hemopoietic function is because of the intrinsic factor which is secreted by gastric glands. Intrinsic factor is essential for absorption of vitamin B12 in the ileum region.<br>
8. Absorptive function is also one of the functions of stomach. Some amount of water and alcohol is absorbed in the stomach region.<br><br>

<strong>Regions of the stomach:</strong><br>
The stomach is divided into 5 regions:<br>

• Cardiac region:<br>
The cardia is the first part of the stomach below the esophagus. It contains the cardiac sphincter, which is a thin ring of muscle that helps to prevent stomach contents from going back up into the esophagus.<br>
• *Fundus:<br>
The fundus is the rounded area that lies to the left of the cardia and below the diaphragm.<br>
• *Body:<br>
The body is the midportion, and as it narrows inferiorly, it becomes the pyloric antrum, and then the funnel-shaped pylorus. This is where food is mixed and starts to break down.<br>
• Antrum:<br>
The antrum is the lower part of the stomach. The antrum holds the broken-down food until it is ready to be released into the small intestine. It is sometimes called the pyloric antrum.<br>
• *Pylorus:<br>
The pylorus is the terminal part of the stomach that connects to the small intestine. This region includes the pyloric sphincter or valve, which is a thick ring of muscle that acts as a valve to control the emptying of stomach contents (chyme) into the duodenum (first part of the small intestine). The pyloric sphincter also prevents the contents of the duodenum from going back into the stomach.<br><br>

• Size:
<br>The stomach varies from 15 to 25 cm in length, but its diameter and volume depend on how much food it contains; when it is full, it can hold about 4 liters (1 gallon) of food, but when it is empty it collapses inward on itself.<br>

• Rugae<br>
The mucosa of the stomach is thrown into large folds called rugae when it is empty.<br>
• Greater curvature<br>
The convex lateral surface of the stomach is the greater curvature.<br>
• Lesser curvature<br>
The concave medial surface is the lesser curvature.<br>
• Lesser omentum<br>
The lesser omentum, a double layer of peritoneum, extends from the liver to the greater curvature.<br>
• Greater omentum<br>
The greater omentum, another extension of the peritoneum, drapes downward and covers the abdominal organs like a lacy apron before attaching to the posterior body wall, and is riddled with fat, which helps to insulate, cushion, and protect the abdominal organs.<br>
• Gastric glands<br>
This otherwise smooth lining is dotted with millions of deep gastric pits, which lead into gastric glands that secrete the solution called gastric juice.<br>
• Intrinsic factor<br>
Some stomach cells produce intrinsic factor, a substance needed for the absorption of vitamin b12 from the small intestine.<br>
• Chyme<br>
After food has been processed, it resembles heavy cream and is called chyme.<br><br>
<div class="image2">
    <img src="img/Digestive-4.jpg" alt="" style="width:60%">
</div>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The stomach is made of these 5 layers:<br>
• Mucosa:<br>
This is the first and innermost layer or lining. It contains the glands that release digestive juices. These are called hydrochloric acid and pepsin. This is where most stomach cancers start.<br>
The mucosa of the stomach is a simple columnar epithelium composed entirely of mucous cells that produce a protective layer of bicarbonate-rich alkaline mucus that clings to the stomach mucosa and protects the stomach wall from being damaged by acid and digested by enzymes.<br>
• Submucosa:<br>
This second layer supports the mucosa. It is rich in blood vessels.<br>

• Muscularis:<br>
The third layer is made of thick muscles. They help to mix food with the digestive juices.<br>

• Subserosa:<br>
This layer contains supporting tissues for the serosa.<br>

• Serosa:<br>
This is the last and outermost layer. It’s the lining that wraps around the stomach to confine it.<br><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Four major types of secretory epithelial cells cover the surface of the stomach and extend down into gastric pits and glands:<br>

• Mucous cells:<br>
Secrete an alkaline mucus that protects the epithelium against shear stress and acid<br>
• Parietal cells:<br>
secrete hydrochloric acid, which makes the stomach contents acidic and activates the enzymes.<br>
• Chief cells:<br>
secrete pepsin, a proteolytic enzyme<br>
• G cells:<br>
Stomach enteroendocrine cells, secrete the hormone gastrin, that are important to the digestive activities of the stomach.<br><br>

</div>

&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>*Small Intestine:</strong><br>
The small intestine is a winding, tightly folded tube. The most part of it can do constriction and relaxation. The small intestine is the body’s major digestive organ. The small intestine or small bowel is an organ in the gastrointestinal tract where most of the end absorption of nutrients and minerals from food takes place. It lies between the stomach and large intestine, and receives bile and pancreatic juice through the pancreatic duct to aid in digestion.<br>
• Location:<br>
The small intestine is a muscular tube extending from the pyloric sphincter to the large intestine.
• Size:<br>
It is the longest section of the alimentary tube, with an average length of 2.5 to 7 m (8 to 20 feet) in a living person.<br><br>

*Function:<br>
The principal function of small intestine is to <u>break down food, absorb nutrients(water, minerals and vitamins) the body needs,</u> and excrete unnecessary components. This gastrointestinal segment also participates in immune functions, acting as a barrier to intraluminal bacteria.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; *Subdivisions. The small intestine has three subdivisions:<br>
the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum, which contribute 5 percent, nearly 40 percent, and almost 60 percent of the small intestine, respectively. Together these can extend up to six meters in length.<br>
The duodenum:<br>
• *The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine. The duodenum extends from the pyloric sphincter of the stomach, wraps around the head of the pancreas in a C-shape and ends at duodenojejunal flexure. The duodenum is the shortest segment of the intestine and is about 20 cm (7.9 inches) to 25 cm (9.8 inches) in length. After foods mix with stomach acid, they(chyme) move into the duodenum, where they mix with bile from the gallbladder and digestive juices from the pancreas. The absorption of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients begins in the duodenum. This part of the small intestine can not do constriction and relaxation.<br>
• *The Jejunum:<br>
The jejunum is the midsection of the small intestine, connecting the duodenum to the ileum. It is about 2.5 m long.<br>
The primary function of the jejunum is to absorb sugars, amino acids, and fatty into the bloodstream. It contains the plicae circulares, and villi that increase its surface area.<br>

• *The Ileum:<br>
The ileum is the last and longest part of the small intestine. It is about 3 m long, and contains villi similar to the jejunum.<br>
The function of the ileum is to absorb any remaining nutrients that did not get absorbed by the duodenum or jejunum, in particular vitamin B12, as well as bile acids that will go on to be recycled.<br><br>


• Ileocecal valve:<br>
The ileum meets the large intestine at the ileocecal valve, which joins the large and small intestine.<br>
• Hepatopancreatic ampulla:<br>
The main pancreatic and bile ducts join at the duodenum to form the flasklike hepatopancreatic ampulla, literally, the ” liver-pacreatic-enlargement”.<br>
• Duodenal papilla:<br>
From there, the bile and pancreatic juice travel through the duodenal papilla and enter the duodenum together.<br>
• Microvilli:<br>
Microvilli are tiny projections of the plasma membrane of the mucosa cells that give the cell surface a fuzzy appearance, sometimes referred to as the brush border; the plasma membranes bear enzymes (brush border enzymes) that complete the digestion of proteins and carbohydrates in the small intestine.<br>
• Villi:<br>
Villi are fingerlike projections of the mucosa that give it a velvety appearance and feel, much like the soft nap of a towel.<br>
• Lacteal:<br>
Within each villus is a rich capillary bed and a modified lymphatic capillary called a lacteal.<br>
• Circular folds:<br>
Circular folds, also called plicae circulares, are deep folds of both mucosa and submucosa layers, and they do not disappear when food fills the small intestine.<br>
• Peyer’s patches:<br>
In contrast, local collections of lymphatic tissue found in the submucosa increase in number toward the end of the small intestine.<br><br>

</div>


&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>*Large Intestine:</strong><br>
The large intestine is much larger in diameter than the small intestine but shorter in length. The large intestine, also known as the large bowel.<br> 
• Size:<br>
About 1.5 m (5 feet) long, it extends from the ileocecal valve to the anus.<br>

• *Functions:<br>
Its major functions are to dry out indigestible food residue by absorbing water and to eliminate these residues from the body as feces.<br>

• *Subdivisions:<br>
It frames the small intestines on three sides and has the following subdivisions: cecum, appendix, colon, rectum, and anal canal.<br>

• *Cecum:<br>
The saclike cecum is the first part of the large intestine and About 6cm long. Beginning caudally from the ileocecal valve and ending blindly in the right iliac fossa.Appendix hanging from the cecum.<br>

• *Appendix:<br>
The appendix is a finger-like, blind-ended tube connected to the cecum, from which it develops in the embryo.<br>
The function of the appendix is unknown. One theory is that the appendix acts as a storehouse for good bacteria, “rebooting” the digestive system after diarrheal illnesses. Other experts believe the appendix is just a useless remnant from our evolutionary past.<br>

• *Ascending colon:<br>
The ascending colon is the part of the colon located between the cecum and the transverse colon and about 15cm long.<br>
When it meets the right lobe of the liver, it turns 90 degrees to move horizontally. This turn is known as the right colic flexure (or hepatic flexure), and marks the start of the transverse colon.<br>
• *Transverse colon:<br>
The transverse colon is the longest and most movable part of the colon and about 50cm long.<br>
The transverse colon extends from the right colic flexure to the spleen, where it turns another 90 degrees to point inferiorly. This turn is known as the left colic flexure (or splenic flexure). Here, the colon is attached to the diaphragm by the phrenicocolic ligament.<br>

• *Descending colon:<br>
The descending colon is the part of the large intestine from the splenic flexure to the beginning of the sigmoid colon and about 50cm long. The function of the descending colon in the digestive system is to store the remains of digested food that will be emptied into the rectum.<br>

• *Sigmoid colon:<br>
The sigmoid colon is the part of the large intestine that is closest to the rectum and anus and about 40cm long.<br>
The intestine then enters the pelvis, where it becomes the S-shaped sigmoid colon.<br>
• *rectum:<br>

The rectum is the last part of the large intestine and connects the sigmoid colon to the anal canal. It is about 12 to 16 cm long. It plays an important role in the defecation process.<br>
It is important for the water resorption as well as for the resorption of electrolyte from the stool.<br>

• *Anal canal:<br>
The anal canal is the terminal segment of the large intestine between the rectum and anus, located below the level of the pelvic diaphragm. It is located within the anal triangle of perineum, between the right and left ischioanal fossa. It is about 2.5 cm long <br>
Function:<br>
The external anal sphincter muscle is the voluntary muscle that surrounds and adheres to the anus at the lower margin of the anal canal. This muscle is in a state of tonic contraction, but during defecation, it relaxes to allow the release of feces.<br>

• *Anus:<br>
The anus is the last part of the digestive tract. It’s at the end of the rectum. It's where stool comes out of the body. It consists of a muscular ring (called a sphincter), that opens during a bowel movement to allow stool (feces) to pass through, as well as flat cells that line the inside of the anus. Most anal cancers start in these flat lining cells. These are also called squamous cells. The lower part of the anus, where it meets the skin, is called the anal margin.<br>

• External anal sphincter:<br>
The anal canal has an external voluntary sphincter, the external anal sphincter, composed of skeletal muscle.<br>

• Internal involuntary sphincter:<br>
The internal involuntary sphincter is formed by smooth muscles.<br><br>

<strong>Accessory Digestive Organs:</strong><br>
Other than the intestines and the stomach, the following are also part of the digestive system:<br><br>
<div class="image2">
    <img src="img/Digestive-9.png" alt="" style="width:100%">
</div>
Teeth:<br>
Teeth are complex structures made of materials specific to them. They are made of a bone-like material called dentin, which is covered by the hardest tissue in the body—enamel.<br>

• Function:<br>
The teeth tear and grind the food, breaking it down into smaller fragments.<br>

• Deciduous teeth:<br>
The first set of teeth is the deciduous teeth, also called baby teeth or milk teeth, and they begin to erupt around 6 months, and a baby has a full set (20 teeth) by the age of 2 years.<br>

• Permanent teeth:<br>
As the second set of teeth, the deeper permanent teeth, enlarge and develop, the roots of the milk teeth are reabsorbed, and between the ages of 6 to 12 years they loosen and fall out.<br>
• Humans have four types of teeth: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, which each have a specific function.<br>

• Incisors:<br>
The chisel-shaped incisors are adapted for cutting.<br>
• Canines:<br>
The fanglike canines are for tearing and piercing.<br>
• Premolars and molars:<br>
Premolars (bicuspids) and molars have broad crowns with round cusps ( tips) and are best suited for grinding.<br>
• Crown:<br>
The enamel-covered crown is the exposed part of the tooth above the gingiva or gum.<br>
• Enamel:<br>
Enamel is the hardest substance in the body and is fairly brittle because it is heavily mineralized with calcium salts.<br>
• Root:<br>
The outer surface of the root is covered by a substance called cementum, which attaches the tooth to the periodontal membrane (ligament).<br>
• Dentin:<br>
Dentin, a bonelike material, underlies the enamel and forms the bulk of the tooth.<br>
• Pulp cavity:<br>
It surrounds a central pulp cavity, which contains a number of structures (connective tissue, blood vessels, and nerve fibers) collectively called the pulp.<br>
• Root canal:<br>
Where the pulp cavity extends into the root, it becomes the root canal, which provides a route for blood vessels, nerves, and other pulp structures to enter the pulp cavity of the tooth.<br><br>
<div class="image2">
    <img src="img/Digestive-7.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%">
</div>
<b>• Salivary Glands:</b><br>
The salivary glands are exocrine glands that produce saliva through a system of ducts. Humans have three paired major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual) as well as hundreds of minor salivary glands. Salivary glands can be classified as serous, mucous or seromucous (mixed).<br>

• Parotid glands:<br>
The two parotid glands are present on either side of the mouth and in front of both ears. They are the largest of the salivary glands. Each parotid is wrapped around the mandibular ramus, and secretes serous saliva through the parotid duct into the mouth.<br>

• Submandibular:<br>
The paired submandibular glands are major salivary glands located beneath the floor of the mouth. They each weigh about 15 grams and contribute some 60–67% of unstimulated saliva secretion.

Sublingual glands:<br>
The paired sublingual glands are major salivary glands in the mouth. They are the smallest, most diffuse, and the only unencapsulated major salivary glands. They provide only 3-5% of the total salivary volume.<br>

• *Saliva:<br>
The product of the salivary glands, saliva, is a mixture of mucus and serous fluids.<br>
Total secretion: 800-1500ml/day.<br>
pH:6- 7.4(Slighty Acidic).<br><br>

*Composition of saliva:<br>
Water: 99.5%<br>
Solid: 0.5%<br>
saliva cellular constituents: Yeast, Bacteria, Protozoa etc.<br>
Organic: Enzyme- Ptyalin, Mucous etc.<br>
Inorganic: NaCl, KCl, CaCo<sub>3</sub> etc.<br>
Gases: O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> etc.<br><br>

*Important functions of saliva:<br>
To lubricate the mouth of a person with the passage of food<br>
To provide help in the swallowing of food being eaten<br>
To provide protection of the teeth against bacteria<br>
Act as an aid in food digestion in the break down process of carbohydrates<br>

• Salivary amylase:<br>
The clear serous portion contains an enzyme, salivary amylase, in a bicarbonate-rich juice that begins the process of starch digestion in the mouth(starchy foods, like potatoes, rice, or pasta).<br><br>
<div class="image2">
    <img src="img/Digestive-8.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%">
</div>
<b>*Pancreas:</b><br>
The pancreas is an organ of the digestive system and endocrine system, but really it serves as two glands in one: a digestive exocrine gland and a hormone-producing endocrine gland. Only the pancreas produces enzymes that break down all categories of digestible foods.<br>

• *Location:<br>
The pancreas is a soft, pink triangular gland that extends across the abdomen from the spleen to the duodenum; but most of the pancreas lies posterior to the parietal peritoneum, hence its location is referred to as retroperitoneal.<br><br>

*Functions of the Pancreas:<br>
A healthy pancreas produces the correct chemicals in the proper quantities, at the right times, to digest the foods we eat.<br>
The pancreas contains exocrine glands that produce enzymes important to digestion. These enzymes include trypsin and chymotrypsin to digest proteins; amylase for the digestion of carbohydrates; and lipase to break down fats. When food enters the stomach, these pancreatic juices are released into a system of ducts that culminate in the main pancreatic duct. The pancreatic duct joins the common bile duct to form the ampulla of Vater which is located at the first portion of the small intestine, called the duodenum. The common bile duct originates in the liver and the gallbladder and produces another important digestive juice called bile. The pancreatic juices and bile that are released into the duodenum, help the body to digest fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.

The pancreatic juices and bile that are released into the duodenum, help the body to digest fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.<br><br>

The pancreatic enzymes are secreted into the duodenum in an alkaline fluid that neutralizes the acidic chyme coming in from the stomach(Pancreatic enzymes, also known as pancreases or pancrelipase and pancreatin).<br><br>

• Endocrine function:<br>
The pancreas also has an endocrine function; it produces hormones insulin and glucagon<br>
The endocrine component of the pancreas consists of islet cells (islets of Langerhans) that create and release important hormones directly into the bloodstream. Two of the main pancreatic hormones are insulin, which acts to lower blood sugar, and glucagon, which acts to raise blood sugar. Maintaining proper blood sugar levels is crucial to the functioning of key organs including the brain, liver, and kidneys.<br><br>

*Pancreatic juice:
Total secretion: 800-1500ml/day.<br>
Ave: 1000ml/daily<br>
pH:8- 8.3(Alkaline).<br><br>

*Composition of Pancreatic juice:<br>
Water: 98.5%<br>
Solid: 1.5%<br><br>

saliva cellular constituents: <br>
Organic: Enzyme (Trypsin, pancreatic amylase, pancreatic lipase, phospholipase)<br>
Inorganic: Catoin- Na, K, Ca, Mg etc.<br>
Anion - HCO<sub> 3</sub> etc<br><br>

<strong>Liver:</strong><br>

The liver is the largest gland in the body.<br>
• Location:<br>
The liver is located in the upper right-hand portion of the abdominal cavity, beneath the diaphragm, and on top of the stomach, right kidney, and intestines.<br>

Shaped like a cone, the liver is a dark reddish-brown organ that weighs about 3 pounds.<br>

The liver consists of 4 distinct lobes — the left, right, caudate, and quadrate lobes.<br>

<b>The left and right lobes</b> are the largest lobes and are separated by the falciform ligament. The right lobe is about 5 to 6 times larger than the tapered left lobe.<br>

The small <b>caudate lobe</b> extends from the posterior side of the right lobe and wraps around the inferior vena cava.<br>

The small <b>quadrate lobe</b> is inferior to the caudate lobe and extends from the posterior side of the right lobe and wraps around the gallbladder.<br><br>

<b>Functions of the liver:</b><br>
The liver regulates most chemical levels in the blood and excretes a product called bile. This helps carry away waste products from the liver. All the blood leaving the stomach and intestines passes through the liver. The liver processes this blood and breaks down, balances, and creates the nutrients and also metabolizes drugs into forms that are easier to use for the rest of the body or that are nontoxic. More than 500 vital functions have been identified with the liver. Some of the more well-known functions include the following:<br>

• Production of bile, which helps carry away waste and break down fats in the small intestine during digestion<br>

• Production of certain proteins for blood plasma<br>

• Production of cholesterol and special proteins to help carry fats through the body<br>

• Conversion of excess glucose into glycogen for storage (glycogen can later be converted back to glucose for energy) and to balance and make glucose as needed <br>

• Regulation of blood levels of amino acids, which form the building blocks of proteins<br>

• Processing of hemoglobin for use of its iron content (the liver stores iron)<br>

• Conversion of poisonous ammonia to urea (urea is an end product of protein metabolism and is excreted in the urine)<br>

• Clearing the blood of drugs and other poisonous substances<br>

• Regulating blood clotting<br>

• Resisting infections by making immune factors and removing bacteria from the bloodstream<br>

• Clearance of bilirubin, also from red blood cells. If there is an accumulation of bilirubin, the skin and eyes turn yellow.<br> 

When the liver has broken down harmful substances, its by-products are excreted into the bile or blood. Bile by-products enter the intestine and leave the body in the form of feces. Blood by-products are filtered out by the kidneys, and leave the body in the form of urine.<br><br>

• Falciform ligament:<br>
The liver has four lobes and is suspended from the diaphragm and abdominal wall by a delicate mesentery cord, the falciform ligament.<br>
• Function:<br>
The liver’s digestive function is to produce bile.<br>
• Bile:<br>
Bile, or gall, is a dark-green-to-yellowish-brown fluid produced by the liver that aids the digestion of lipids in the small intestine. In humans, bile is produced continuously by the liver (liver bile) and stored and concentrated in the gallbladder. After eating, this stored bile is discharged into the duodenum.
Bile is composed of bile acids and salts, phospholipids, cholesterol, pigments, water, and electrolyte chemicals that keep the total solution slightly alkaline (with a pH of about 7 to 8). About 400 to 800 millilitres of bile is produced per day in adult human beings.<br><br>

• Bile salts:<br>
Bile does not contain enzymes but its bile salts emulsify fats by physically breaking large fat globules into smaller ones, thus providing more surface area for the fat-digesting enzymes to work on.<br><br>
 
Gallbladder:<br>
The gallbladder is a pear-shaped, hollow structure located under the liver and on the right side of the abdomen. Its primary function is to store and concentrate bile, a yellow-brown digestive enzyme produced by the liver. The gallbladder is part of the biliary tract.<br><br>

• Cystic duct:<br>
A tube that carries bile from the gall bladder. It joins the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct. It is part of the biliary duct system.
When food digestion is not occurring, bile backs up the cystic duct and enters the gallbladder to be stored.<br><br>

<strong>Physiology of the Digestive System:</strong><br>
Specifically, the digestive system takes in food (ingests it), breaks it down physically and chemically into nutrient molecules (digests it), and absorbs the nutrients into the bloodstream, then, it rids the body of indigestible remains (defecates).<br>
 
Activities Occurring in the Mouth, Pharynx, and Esophagus<br>

The activities that occur in the mouth, pharynx, and esophagus are food ingestion, food breakdown, and food propulsion.<br>

Food Ingestion and Breakdown<br>

Once food is placed in the mouth, both mechanical and chemical digestion begin.<br>

• Physical breakdown:<br>
First, the food is physically broken down into smaller particles by chewing.<br><br>
• Chemical breakdown:<br>
Then, as the food is mixed with saliva, salivary amylase begins the chemical digestion of starch, breaking it down into maltose.<br><br>
• Stimulation of saliva:<br>
When food enters the mouth, much larger amounts of saliva pour out; however, the simple pressure of anything put into the mouth and chewed will also stimulate the release of saliva.<br><br>
• Passageways:<br>
The pharynx and the esophagus have no digestive function; they simply provide passageways to carry food to the next processing site, the stomach.
Food Propulsion – Swallowing and Peristalsis
For food to be sent on its way to the mouth, it must first be swallowed.<br><br>
• Deglutition:<br>
Deglutition, or swallowing, is a complex process that involves the coordinated activity of several structures (tongue, soft palate, pharynx, and esophagus).<br><br>

• Buccal phase of deglutition. The first phase, the voluntary buccal phase, occurs in the mouth; once the food has been chewed and well mixed with saliva, the bolus (food mass) is forced into the pharynx by the tongue.<br><br>

• Pharyngeal-esophageal phase:<br>
The second phase, the involuntary pharyngeal-esophageal phase, transports food through the pharynx and esophagus; the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system controls this phase and promotes the mobility of the digestive organs from this point on.<br><br>

• Food routes:<br>
All routes that the food may take, except the desired route distal into the digestive tract, are blocked off; the tongue blocks off the mouth; the soft palate closes off the nasal passages; the larynx rises so that its opening is covered by the flaplike epiglottis.<br><br>

• Stomach entrance:<br>
Once food reaches the distal end of the esophagus, it presses against the cardioesophageal sphincter, causing it to open, and food enters the stomach.<br><br>
 
Activities of the Stomach:<br>
The activities of the stomach involve food breakdown and food propulsion.<br><br>

Food Breakdown<br>
The sight, smell, and taste of food stimulate parasympathetic nervous system reflexes, which increase the secretion of gastric juice by the stomach glands<br><br>
• Gastric juice:<br>
Secretion of gastric juice is regulated by both neural and hormonal factors.<br>
• Gastrin:<br>
The presence of food and a rising pH in the stomach stimulate the stomach cells to release the hormone gastrin, which prods the stomach glands to produce still more of the protein-digesting enzymes (pepsinogen), mucus, and hydrochloric acid.<br><br>

• Pepsinogen:<br>
The extremely acidic environment that hydrochloric acid provides is necessary, because it activates pepsinogen to pepsin, the active protein-digesting enzyme.<br><br>

• Rennin:<br>
Rennin, known also as Chymosin, is the second protein-digesting(proteolytic) enzyme produced by the stomach, works primarily on milk protein and converts it to a substance that looks like sour milk.<br><br>

• Food entry:<br>
As food enters and fills the stomach, its wall begins to stretch (at the same time as the gastric juices are being secreted).<br><br>

• Stomach wall activation:<br>
Then the three muscle layers of the stomach wall become active; they compress and pummel the food, breaking it apart physically, all the while continuously mixing the food with the enzyme-containing gastric juice so that the semifluid chyme is formed.<br><br>
 
Food Propulsion:<br>
Peristalsis is responsible for the movement of food towards the digestive site until the intestines.<br><br>

• Peristalsis:<br>
Once the food has been well mixed, a rippling peristalsis begins in the upper half of the stomach, and the contractions increase in force as the food approaches the pyloric valve.<br><br>

• Pyloric passage:<br>
The pylorus of the stomach, which holds about 30 ml of chyme, acts like a meter that allows only liquids and very small particles to pass through the pyloric sphincter; and because the pyloric sphincter barely opens, each contraction of the stomach muscle squirts 3 ml or less of chyme into the small intestine.<br><br>

• Enterogastric reflex:<br>
When the duodenum is filled with chyme and its wall is stretched, a nervous reflex, the enterogastric reflex, occurs; this reflex “puts the brakes on” gastric activity and slows the emptying of the stomach by inhibiting the vagus nerves and tightening the pyloric sphincter, thus allowing time for intestinal processing to catch up.<br><br>
 
Activities of the Large Intestine:<br>
The activities of the large intestine are food breakdown and absorption and defecation.<br><br>

Food Breakdown and Absorption<br>
What is finally delivered to the large intestine contains few nutrients, but that residue still has 12 to 24 hours more to spend there.<br><br>

• Metabolism:<br>
The “resident” bacteria that live in its lumen metabolize some of the remaining nutrients, releasing gases (methane and hydrogen sulfide) that contribute to the odor of feces.<br><br>

• Flatus:<br>
About 50 ml of gas (flatus) is produced each day, much more when certain carbohydrate-rich foods are eaten.<br><br>

• Absorption:<br>
Absorption by the large intestine is limited to the absorption of vitamin K, some B vitamins, some ions, and most of the remaining water.<br><br>

• Feces:<br>
Feces, the more or less solid product delivered to the rectum, contains undigested food residues, mucus, millions of bacteria, and just enough water to allow their smooth passage.<br><br>
 
Propulsion of the Residue and Defecation<br>
When presented with residue, the colon becomes mobile, but its contractions are sluggish or short-lived.<br><br>

• Haustral contractions:<br>
The movements most seen in the colon are haustral contractions, slow segmenting movements lasting about one minute that occur every 30 minutes or so.<br><br>

• Propulsion:<br>
As the haustrum fills with food residue, the distension stimulates its muscle to contract, which propels the luminal contents into the next haustrum.<br><br>

• Mass movements:<br>
Mass movements are long, slow-moving, but powerful contractile waves that move over large areas of the colon three or four times daily and force the contents toward the rectum.<br><br>

• Rectum:<br>
The rectum is generally empty, but when feces are forced into it by mass movements and its wall is stretched, the defecation reflex is initiated.<br><br>

• Defecation reflex:<br>
The defecation reflex is a spinal (sacral region) reflex that causes the walls of the sigmoid colon and the rectum to contract and anal sphincters to relax.<br><br>

• Impulses:<br>
As the feces is forced into the anal canal, messages reach the brain giving us time to make a decision as to whether the external voluntary sphincter should remain open or be constricted to stop passage of feces.<br><br>

• Relaxation:<br>
Within a few seconds, the reflex contractions end and rectal walls relax; with the next mass movement, the defecation reflex is initiated again.<br><br>
