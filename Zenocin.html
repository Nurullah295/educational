Short Detailing<br>
Dear Sir/Madam:<br>
Good morning/ evening. If you permit, today I would like to share about a 1st Time in Bangaldesh product 
Zenocin, a<br>
preparation of Ozenoxacin.<br>
impetigo is the most common skin infection in children. Conventional drugs (Retapamulin,
Mupirocin & Fusidic acid) are used to treat impetigo but they have some limitations like antimicrobial resistance, adverse effects etc. What is your opinion sir? For better treatment of impetigo, Navana Pharma has introduced, 1st Time in<br>
Bangladesh, Zenocin A preparation of Ozenoxacin.<br>
&#8227;  It is a non-fluorinated topical quinolone which shows no resistance, phototoxicity & chondrotoxicity.<br>
&#8227;  Dual action of Zenocin ensures better efficacy<br>
&#8227;  An ideal choice for Impetigo<br>
&#8227;  Potential to be a rapid and effective new treatment for Impetigo<br>
&#8227;  Ensures patients' compliance<br><br>

Considering these benefits, may I expect 3 Rx of Zenocin daily? I have made Zenocin available in all nearby pharmacies<br> so<br>
that your Rx will be honoured. Thank you sir.<br><br>
