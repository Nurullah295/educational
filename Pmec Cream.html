<b>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</b><br>
<b>1. What is Atopic Dermatitis?</b><br>
Ans: Atopic Dermatitis is the most common form of eczema, a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, dry and
cracked. Atopic Dermatitis is more common in children with a high disease rate of 20% to 30%. But it may also
develop for the first time in adults with a disease rate of 7% to 10%.<br>
<b>2. What are the available treatment options for Atopic Dermatitis?</b><br>
Ans: The most commonly used treatment options include:<br>
◆Topical Steroids.<br>
◆Crisaborole Ointment.<br>
◆Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors.<br>
◆ Phototherapy.<br>
	
<b>3. Why topical steroids are not a proper treatment option for Atopic Dermatitis?</b><br>
Ans: Conventionally, topical steroids have been the mainstay of drug therapy for Atopic Dermatitis. However, topical
steroids show serious adverse effects like skin atrophy, skin eruption, telangiectasia, hypertrichosis etc. On the other
hand, topical steroids rarely shows some serious systemic adverse events like suppression of adrenal glands, Cushing's
syndrome, delayed wound healing, growth retardation in young children, cataracts, glaucoma etc.<br>
	
<b>4. How Pimecrolimus is better than Tacrolimus?</b><br>
	
Ans: Tacrolimus is also a topical calcineurin inhibitor like Pimecrolimus. A number of studies showed:<br>
◆ Pimecrolimus 1% cream has greater reduction rate of Atopic Dermatitis on head & neck area than Tacrolimus 0.03%
ointment.<br>
◆ Pimecrolimus 1% cream has better patient compliance that Tacrolimus 0.03% ointment because it provides
suitability for use on sensitive facial skin, non-sticky feel, ease of application, ease of rub & spreadibility.<br>
	
<b>5. Can Pimecrolimus be given in pregnant women?</b><br>
	
Ans: Pregnancy Category C. So it should not be prescribed to pregnant women.<br><br>
	


Opening (Clarification of visual- No more steroid to treat atopic dermatitis)<br>
Need Assessment<br>
Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
We are very pleased to let you know that, we have introduced a very
effective & absolutely steroid free topical option to manage Atopic
Dermatitis.<br>
	
2nd Page<br>
Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
Topical steroids are prescribed as mainstay in the treatment of Atopic
Dermatitis for many years. But you will definitely agree with me that,
corticosteroids show serious adverse effects.
For the management of Atopic Dermatitis, We offer you Pmec, the
preparation of Pimecrolimus 1% cream, that is manufactured in
Bangladesh by Navana Pharma, what is absolutely steroid free.
FDA has approved to use the Pmec, that is Pimecrolimus Cream from 2
years of age & older.<br>
	
3rd Page<br>
Unlike Steorid, Pmec works very selectively. Pmec selectively
inhibits Calcineurin to prevent the activation of T-cells, what stops the
progression of Atopic Dermatitis.

Significantly reduces flare in children with AD:<br>
Study found the impressive response of Pmec in reducing the risk of flare compared to emollient vehicle in atopic dermatitis. Pmec reduces the risk of a single flare by 67% patients where emollient
based vehicle reduces only in 30% patients.<br>
So, Pmec is the deal choice to treat Atopic Dermatitis among
children.<br>
(Type of Study: Double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Place of Study: Germany. No. of Child Patients: 251. Drugs Used : Pimecrolimus 1% cream
(twice daily) to 204 patients
& vehicle to 47 patients.
Duration: 1 year)<br><br>


4th Page<br>
Greater reduction rate of Atopic Dermatitis on head & neck area:<br>
You will be glad to know that, Pmec, that is Pimecrolimus shows greater
efficacy even than Tacrolimus in the sensitive skin area. Pmec reduces the Atopic Dermatitis affected body surface area by 54% where as Tacrolimus reduces only 35%.<br>
So, Pmec effectively manage AD than tacrolimus, especially in sensitive skin area.<br>
(Type of Study: Multicenter, randomized, parallel-group study.
Place of Study: USA. No. of Patients : 139. Age: 2-17 years. Drugs Used: Pimecrolimus 1% cream (twice daily) to 70 patients and Tacrolimus 0.03% ointment to 69 patients
Duration: 6 weeks.)<br><br>

Better patient compliance than Tacrolimus:<br>
Due to less systemic absorption & Cream preparation, patient satisfaction with Pimecrolimus is much higher than tacrolimus in all the parameters.<br>
Among the individual users<br>

◆ 63% of patients rated Pmec good to Excellent to use it in sensitive
facial area where Tacrolimus got it by 39% users.<br>

◆ 75% patients rated Pmec excellent due to non-sticky feelings
where Tacrolimus got it only by 37%.<br>
◆ 76% patients found Pmec excellent in Ease of application where Tacrolimus got it by only 69%.
<br>
◆ 75% patients found Pmec excellent in Ease rubbing where
Tacrolimus got it by only 56%.<br>

◆ 72% patients found Pmec excellent in Spreadability where
Tacrolimus got it by only 57%.<br>

◆ So it can be said undoubtedly that, Pmec provides better patientssatisfaction than Tacrolimus.<br>
(Type of Study: Multicenter, randomized, parallel-group study.
Place of Study: USA. No. of Patients : 141. Age: 2-17 years. Drugs Used :Pimecrolimus 1% cream (twice daily) to 71 patients and Tacrolimus 0.03% ointment to 70 patients

5th Page<br>
Significantly reduces depigmentation in sensitive skin area among infants with Vitiligo<br>
Not only for Atopic Dermatitis, Pmec also can be used to manage
Vitiligo specially in pediatric patients. Pmec significantly reduces
depigmentation in sensitive skin area among infants with Vitiligo.
Study found that, Pmec treatment shows 75% re-pigmentation
perineum area of children. Pmec also found effective to manage
vitiligo in other various part specially in Head & Neck, Trunk &
Extremities area.<br>
(Type of Study: Randomized.
Place of Study: Switzerland.
No. of Patients : 46.
Age: <2 years.
Drug Used: Pimecrolimus 1% cream (twice daily).
Duration: 6 months.)<br><br>


6th Page<br>
I think, you may now agree with me that, Pmec efficiently treats dermatitis without bothersome side effects of steroid.<br>
So Pmec<br>
◆ A Non-steroidal treatment option for AD.<br>

◆ Ensures safety in pediatric patients of 2 years and older.<br>

◆ Provides greater patients compliance than Tacrolimus.<br>

◆ A drug of choice for Vitiligo.<br>

<b>Short Detail talk</b><br>
Sir/Madam,<br>
Good morning/evening, today I would like to inform you about a new product to treat Atopic Dermatitis, which is
totally a steroid free preparation! <br>
Sir/Madam,<br>
you know, steroid has been used to treat Atopic Dermatitis for a long
time. You must know that steroids have a lot of side effects. So, long term use of steroids is risky. We offer you Pmec
Cream, preparation of Pimecrolimus 1%, which is manufactured for the first time in Bangladesh by NAVANA
PHARMA.<br>
Pmec efficiently treats Atopic Dermatitis without bothersome side effects of steroids, which can be safely
used from children of 2 years of age and above. Pmec is recommended to use twice daily over the affected area.
Pmec is much superior to Tacrolimus in case of efficacy in sensitive skin & tolerability. Pmec is available in your
adjacent chemist. So, I cordially request you to prescribe Pmec cream for the next available patient of Atopic
Dermatitis comes to you. I strongly believe that you will be happy by the response of this product.<br><br>

<b>Abridged Prescribe Information:</b><br>
<b>Composition:</b><br>
 <b>Pmec Cream:</b><br>
Each gram cream contains Pimecrolimus INN 10 mg.<br>

<b>Pharmacology: </b><br>
The mechanism of action of Pimecrolimus in atopic dermatitis is not known. It has been demonstrated that Pimecrolimus binds with macrophilin-12 (FKBP-12) and inhibits the calcium-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin. As a consequence, it inhibits T-cell activation.
In particular, Pimecrolimus inhibits Interleukin-2 and Interferon gamma (Th1-type), Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-10 (Th2-type) cytokine synthesis in human T-cells. In addition, Pimecrolimus prevents the release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators from mast cells in vitro after stimulation by antigen/IgE. 
<br>
<b>Indication:</b><br>
Pmec Cream is indicated as
second-line therapy for the short-term and noncontinuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in non-immunocompromised adults and children 2 years of age and older, who have failed to respond adequately to other topical prescription treatments or when those treatments are not advisable.

Treatment should be stopped if signs and symptoms (e.g. itch, rash and redness) resolve. If signs and symptoms persist and beyond 6 weeks, patients should be re-examined to confirm the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis.<br>

A patient should not use sun lamps,
tanning beds, or get treatment with ultraviolet light therapy during treatment with Pmec Cream. Continuous long-term use of Pimecrolimus should be avoided. A patient should not cover
the skin being treated with bandages, dressings or wraps. Loose fitting clothing that protects the treated area from the sun are encouraged.<br>
