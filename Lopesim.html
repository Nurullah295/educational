<b>Prescribing Information:</b><br>

<b>Composition:</b><br>
Lopesim: Each tablet contains Loperamide Hydrochloride USP 2 mg and Simethicone USP 125 mg.<br>

<b>Pharmacology:</b><br>
Diarrhoea may be defined as an imbalance of one or a combination of activities in the gut which include secretion, absorption and gastrointestinal motility. Loperamide Hydrochloride has been shown to act on all of these function via cholinergic, non-cholinergic, opiate and non-opiate receptor mediated mechanisms thus enhancing fecal consistency by reducing reabsorption of water and electrolytes and reduces the frequency of faecal output. Simethicone is an antiflatulent that changes surface tension of gas bubbles, allowing easier elimination of gas and reduces abdominal cramping.<br>

<b>Indications:</b><br>
Lopesim is indicated for the symptomatic relief of acute non-specific diarrhoea associated with gas-related
abdominal discomfort such as, bloating, abdominal pain and cramping. It is also indicated for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) & ulcerative colitis.<br>

<b>Dosage & Administration:</b><br>
<u>Adults and children 12 years of age and older:</u><br>
The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two tablets) followed by 2 mg (one tablet) after each subsequent loose bowel movement, up to a maximum of 8 mg (four tablets) a day for not more than 2 days.<br>
<u>Children 9-11 years of age:</u><br>
The proposed dose is one tablet after the first loose bowel movement and half tablet after each subsequent loose bowel movement, up to a maximum three tablets (for ages 9-11
years) or maximum 2 tablets (for ages 6-8 years) per day, for no longer than 2 days.<br>
<u>This drug is not recommended for children under 2 years of age or as directed by the physician.</u><br>

<b>Contraindication:</b><br>
• Loperamide Hydrochloride/Simethicone is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to this drug or any of its components.<br>
• Loperamide Hydrochloride/Simethicone is contraindicated for use in children under 2 years of age.<br>
• Loperamide Hydrochloride/Simethicone is contraindicated in those in whom constipation must be avoided.<br>

<b>Warnings & Precautions:</b><br>
If clinical improvement is not observed within 48 hours, the administration of Loperamide Hydrochloride/Simethicone should be discontinued and patients should be advised to consult with their physician.<br>

<b>Side Effects:</b><br>
With use of Loperamide Hydrochloride, occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, such as skin rash and urticaria, and extremely rare cases of anaphylactic reaction (including anaphylactic shock).<br>

<b>Use in Pregnancy & Lactation:</b><br>
Safe use of Loperamide Hydrochloride/Simethicone during pregnancy has not been established. Small amounts of Loperamide may appear in human breast milk. Therefore, Loperamide Hydrochloride/Simethicone is not recommended
during breast-feeding.<br>

<b>Use in Children & Adolescents:</b><br>
The use of Loperamide Hydrochloride/Simethicone is not recommended for children under 2 years of age except on the advice of a physician.<br>

<b>Drug Interactions:</b><br>
Non-clinical data have shown that Loperamide is a P-glycoprotein substrate. Concomitant administration of Loperamide (16 mg single dose) with quinidine, or ritonavir, which are both P-glycoprotein inhibitors, resulted in a 2 to 3-fold increase in Loperamide plasma levels. The concomitant administration of Loperamide (4 mg single dose) and Itraconazole, an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P glycoprotein, resulted in a 3
to 4 fold increase in Loperamide plasma concentrations.<br>

<b>Overdosage:</b><br>
In case of overdosage of Loperamide may result in nausea, constipation, central nervous system depression, urinary retention and paralytic ileus.<br>

<b>Storage:</b><br>
Store below 30°C, away from light and in a dry place. Keep all medicines out of the reach of children.

<b>Packing:</b><br>
Lopesim: Each box contains 3 X 10 tablets in Alu-Alu blister pack and an insert.<br><br>
