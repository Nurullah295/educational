<strong>Gout:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Gout is a painful form of arthritis that occurs when high levels of <span>uric acid</span> in the blood cause crystals to form and accumulate in and around a joint.<br>
&#x2022; It is more likely to affect men<br>
&#x2022; Affect women after the menopause<br><br>

<b>Symptoms:</b><br>

&#x2022; Urinary Alkaliniser<br><br>


<strong>Acidosis (Renal tubular acidosis)</strong><br>
&#x2022; RTA is a disease that occurs when the kidneys fail to excrete acids into the urine<br>
&#x2022; It may be caused by failure to reabsorb bicarbonate ions (Proximal tubule) or by secretion of hydrogen ions (distal tubule)<br><br>

<b>Symptoms</b><br>
&#x2022; Confusion, Fatigue<br>
&#x2022; Increased breathing rate<br>
&#x2022; Kidney stones<br>
&#x2022; Calcium deposited in kidneys<br>

<b>Treatment</b><br>
&#x2022; Urinary Alkaliniser<br>
&#x2022; Diuretics<br><br>

<strong>&#x2022; Alkaliniser:</strong> <br>
Agent that neutralizes acidity in blood (less acidic).<br>

<strong>&#x2022; Alkalization:</strong><br>
A process that lowers the amount of acid in blood.<br>

<strong>&#x2022; Acidosis:</strong><br>
It refers to an excess of acid in the blood<br>

<strong>&#x2022; Alkalinizing agents:</strong> <br>
Alkalinizing agents are drugs used to manage disorders associated with low pH e.g. Acidosis.<br>

<strong>&#x2022; Uricosuric agents:</strong> <br>
These are substances that increase the excretion of uric acid in the urine. e.g. Allopurinol, Probenecid.<br><br>


<strong>Mood of Action:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Potassium citrate is absorbed and metabolized to potassium bicarbonate and this acts as a systemic alkalizer<br><br>
