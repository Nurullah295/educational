The power of partnership<br><br>
The most popular choice to treat LDL-C is Atorvastatin but it requires a high dose that may cause
several side effects. Ezetimibe, also a lipid lowering agent which prevents absorbtion of
cholesterol from food. On the other hand, combination of Atorvastatin & Ezetimibe ensures dual
mode of action and reduces LDL-C effectively with a very low dose.<br><br>


Provides synergistic action¹
Ezetimibe
↓
Works in the small intestine &
inhibits the absorption of
cholesterol that comes from food
Atorvastatin
↓
Reduces the cholesterol production
in the liver by blocking
HMG-CoA reductase enzyme
Synergistic effect reduces cholesterol significantly

<b>Abridged Prescribing Information</b><br>
<b>Composition: Ezitor 10/10:</b><br>
 Each film coated tablet contains Ezetimibe USP 10 mg and Atorvastatin calcium equivalent to Atorvastatin 10 mg.<br> 
 <b>Ezitor 10/20:</b><br> 
 Each film coated tablet contains Ezetimibe USP 10 mg and Atorvastatin calcium equivalent to Atorvastatin 20 mg.<br>
 <b>Indication:</b><br>  
 Ezitor is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to: • reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, TG, and non-HDL-C, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hyperlipidemia or mixed hyperlipidemia. • reduce elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments.<br>
<b>Dosage and Administration:</b><br> 
• Dosage range is 10/10 mg/day through 10/80 mg/day. • Recommended starting dose is 10/10 mg/day or 10/20 mg/day. • Recommended starting dose is 10/40 mg/day for patients requiring a greater than 55% reduction in LDL-C or as directed by the physician.<br> 
<b>Contraindication:</b><br> 
• Active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of hepatic transaminase levels. • Hypersensitivity to any Ezetimibe & Atorvastatin. • Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. • Nursing mothers <br>
<b>Warnings & Precautions:</b><br> 
• Patients need to contact physicians in case of any muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. • Combination therapy of Ezetimibe & Atorvastatin should be discontinued immediately if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. • Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis): Risks increase with higher doses and concomitant use of certain CYP3A4 inhibitors, fibric acid derivatives, and cyclosporine. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure 
secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. • Liver enzyme abnormalities: Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before
initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter.<br> 
<b>Side Effects:</b><br> 
Common side effects are: increased ALT, increased AST, and musculoskeletal pain. <br>
<b>Use in Pregnancy</b><br>
and Lactation: It may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk. Statins have the potential
for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require Ezitor treatment should not breast-feed their infants. <br>
<b>Use in Children & Adolescents:</b><br> 
Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric & adolescent patients.<br> 
<b>Drug Interaction:</b><br> 
• Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C
protease inhibitor (telaprevir), gemfibrozil- Avoid Ezitor • HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir)- Use with caution and lowest dose necessary. • Clarithromycin,
itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir)- Do not exceed 10/20 mg EzitorT daily. •
HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir)-Do not exceed 10/40 mg. Ezitor daily. • Other lipid-lowering medications: Use with fenofibrates or
lipid-modifying doses (≥1 g/day) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with Ezitor. • Fenofibrates:
Combination increases exposure of ezetimibe. If cholelithiasis is suspected in a patient receiving ezetimibe and afenofibrate, gallbladder studies are indicated and alternative
lipid-lowering therapy should be considered. • Cholestyramine: Combination decreases exposure of ezetimibe. • Digoxin: Patients should be monitored appropriately. • Oral
contraceptives: Values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol may be increased. • Rifampin should be simultaneously coadministered with Azitor. <br>
<b>Overdose:</b><br> 
No specific treatment for overdosage with Ezitor can be recommended. In the event of an overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted as
required.<br>
