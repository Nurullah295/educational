<b>Presentation</b><br>
Momespray Nasal Spray : Momespray Nasal Spray is a metered-dose spray containing an aqueous suspension of Mometasone Furoate BP. Each actuation delivers a metered spray of 50 &#956;g of Mometasone Furoate. Each bottle of Momespray Nasal Spray provides 120 metered doses of Mometasone Furoate.
<br><br>

<b>Description</b><br>
Mometasone is a corticosteroid demonstrating anti-inflammatory properties. The precise 
mechanism of corticosteroid's action on allergic rhinitis is not known. Corticosteroids 
have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, 
eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, 
eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation.

<b>Indication:</b><br>
Momespray Nasal Spray is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of the nasal 
symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis and for the prophylaxis of the nasal symptoms 
of perennial allergic rhinitis, in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and 
older. It is also indicated for the treatment of nasal polyps in patients 18 years 
of age and older.
<br><br>

<b>Dosage & Administration:</b><br>
<b>Allergic Rhinitis:</b><br>
<li> Adults and Children 12 Years of Age and Older:</li>
The recommended dose for prophylaxis and treatment of the nasal symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis and prophylaxis of the 
nasal symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis is 2 sprays(100 mcg) in each nostril once daily.<br> 
Increase to 200 mcg into each nostril once daily if needed.<br> 
Maintenance: 50 mcg in each nostril daily.<br>
In patients with a known seasonal allergen that precipitates nasal symptoms of seasonal 
allergic rhinitis, prophylaxis with Momespray Nasal Spray is recommended 2 to 4 weeks 
prior to the anticipated start of the pollen season.<br>

<li> Nasal Polyps:</li>
Adults 18 years of Age and Older: The recommended dose for nasal polyps 
is 2 sprays(100 mcg) in each nostril twice daily. A dose of 2 sprays in each nostril once 
daily is also effective in some patients.
<br><br>

<b>Pregnancy:</b><br>
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Mometasone Furoate, like other corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus.
<br><br>

<b>Lactation:</b><br>
It is not known if Mometasone Furoate is excreted in human milk. Since other corticosteroids are excreted in human milk, caution should be used when Mometasone Furoate is administered to nursing women.
<br><br>

<b>Children:</b><br>
Children 2 to 11 Years of Age:<br>
The recommended dose for treatment of the nasal symptoms of seasonal allergic and perennial allergic rhinitis is 1 spray in each nostril once daily

<b>Action:</b><br>
<br><br>

<b>Mode of Action:</b><br>

In asthma, mometasone is believed to inhibit mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and lymphocytes3. There is also evidence of inhibition of histamine, leukotrienes, and cytokines.<br>

Corticosteroids diffuse across cell membranes into the cytosol of cells where they bind to glucocorticoid receptors to produce their activity2. Mometasone furoate has a particularly high receptor affinity compare to other corticosteroids, 22 times higher than that of dexamethasone. Mometasone furoate binding to a glucocorticoid receptor causes conformational changes in the receptor, separation from chaperones, and the receptor moves to the nucleus3. Once at the nucleus, receptors dimerize and bind to a DNA sequence known as the glucocorticoid response element which either increases expression of anti-inflammatory molecules or inhibits expression of pro-inflammatory molecules (such as interleukins 4 and 5). Mometasone furoate also reduces inflammation by blocking transcription factors such as activator-protein-1 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB)

<b>Side effects:</b><br>
Generally side effects are mild and included headache, viral infection, sore throat, nosebleeds and coughing.
<br><br>

<b>Contraindication:</b><br>
<br><br>

<b>Precautions and warnings:</b><br>
Use with caution in active or inactive tuberculosis infection, herpes simplex virus infection of the eye, untreated infections affecting the body as a whole etc.
<br><br>

<b>Interaction:</b><br>
There are no drug interactions of note with Mometasone Furoate.
<br><br>

<b>Over Dose:</b><br>
There are no data available on the effects of acute or chronic over dosage with Mometasone Furoate. Because of low systemic bioavailability, and an absence of acute drug-related systemic findings in clinical studies, overdose is unlikely to require any therapy other than observation.
