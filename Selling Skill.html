<strong>5 Secrets of Failure -</strong><br>

1. 82% fails to differentiate (Product, Company, Himself)<br>
2. 99% set wrong call objectives<br>
3. 86% ask wrong questions<br>
4. 95% talks too much<br>
5. 62% fails to take commitment<br><br>

<strong>Two Basic Approaches in Business Development</strong><br>
&#9734; Product development through Product-wise doctor selection<br>
&#x2022; If you are searching right doctors for achieving the target and establishing Glix tablet, then you are following this approach. Here product Glix is fixed, but doctors are variable.<br>

&#9734; Doctor development through Doctor-wise product selection<br>
&#x2022; If are trying to develop Dr. X as an Advocate of Navana through selecting/prescribing products at you choice, then you are following this approach. Here doctor X is fixed, but products are variable.<br><br>

<strong>Activities in the Selling Process (Product Development):</strong><br>
1. Prospecting :<br> 
Identify potential prescriber of your products<br>
2. Classify Suspects and Qualifying:<br> 
Categorize doctors based on their potentiality and possibility of prescribing your product<br>
3. Develop a Selling Strategy and Call Objectives:<br> 
Set the basic strategy for generating prescriptions from the prospect and objective of the first call by matching a key need to a product benefit.<br>
4. Make the approach:<br> 
Gain the attention and interest of the prospect using the need benefit match selected above.<br>
5. Make the presentation:<br> 
Expand on the product benefits to satisfy needs and checking for objections.<br>
6. Trial Close:<br> 
Test close on a minor point to see if the prospect is accepting the benefits and is ready to prescribe.<br>
7. Handling objections: <br>
Accept objections as form of feedback. Clarify needs and provide proof that the product benefits will meet the needs.<br>
8. Conclude presentation and close: <br>
When a sufficient number of benefits have been accepted, the sales person will move to close, which is basically asking for prescription.<br>
9. Follow-up: <br>
Collect feedback from doctors, ensure availability of the product and convert the doctor as Repeat Customer.<br>


<strong>Six Stages of developing Customer Loyalty (Doctor Development):</strong><br>
1. Suspect or Lead<br>
2. Prospect<br>
3. First-Time Customer<br>
4. Repeat Customer<br>
5. Client<br>
6. Advocate<br><br>


<strong>Pharmaceutical SELLING:</strong><br>
Pharmaceutical SELLING is generating prescription from a physician in favor of a product and converting a physician to Advocate of the company.<br><br>
<div class="a">
<strong>Step-1: Prospecting:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Prospecting is searching for Prospects (doctors having scope to prescribe a specific product).<br>
&#x2022; Develop the prospecting attitude. Prospecting is a way of life and should be done constantly and consistently.<br>
&#x2022; Develop a genuine interest in and for other people (Doctor, Chemist, Competitor, Patient, Nurse).<br><br>

<strong>Key Elements for Successful Prospecting:</strong><br>

&#9734; Rx study<br>
&#x2022; Indication for which the drug has been prescribed<br>
&#x2022; Concomitant diseases<br>
&#x2022; Age/sex of the patient<br>
&#x2022; Diagnostic tests done<br>
&#x2022; Previous doctors<br>
&#x2022; Previous medicines<br><br>

&#9734; Prescription audit<br>
&#x2022; Self survey<br>
&#x2022; Rx Analysis<br><br>

&#9734; Utilization of MRD Survey and 4P Survey<br><strong>1.2</strong><br><br>


<div class="a">
<strong>Step-2:Qualifying:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Qualifiing is the process of assessing prospective customers to determine appropriate action.<br>
&#x2022; This is usually to decide whether it is worth putting any effort into the sale.<br>
&#x2022; In Pharmaceutical Selling, Qualifying means confirm Target Product(s) for a Doctor.<br><br>


<strong>Qualifying Activities:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Development of complete physician’s profile through Prescription Audit<br>
&#x2022; Collecting all sorts of competitive information related to the physician<br>
&#x2022; Deciding to visit the physician to generate prescription after analyzing, verifying and justifying all the available information<br>
&#x2022; Product(s) selection for promotion<br><br>


<strong>Factors to consider during product selection:</strong><br>
&#9734; Value of prescription<br>
&#x2022; Daily treatment cost<br>
&#x2022; Total treatment cost<br><br>

&#9734; Life cycle of the prescription<br>
&#x2022; Refill chance leading to OTC<br>
&#x2022; Development of follower<br>
&#x2022; Probability of replacement (by other doctor or chemist)<br><br>

&#9734; Specialty match product (usually the number one product of a prescription e.g. a diabetologist will prescribe anti- diabetic product in S1. Number 1 after diagnosis of diabetes)<br>
&#9734; Concomitant disease management product (e.g. hypertension in diabetes, anxiety in hypertension etc.)<br>
&#9734; Supplementary products (vitamins after surgery, calcium after delivery)<br>
&#9734; Accessory products (sleeping pill for old patients)<br>
&#9734; Placebo products i.e. products prescribed to please the patient without having any clinical justification (most vitamins and minerals are prescribed in this way)<br>
&#9734; Purchasing capability of the patient<br>
&#9734; Company objective and strategy<br>
&#9734; Competitor’s current strategy<br>
&#9734; Competitor’s future strategy<br>
&#9734; Basic motivating factors of the physician<br>
&#9734; Loyalty pattern of the doctor<br><br>

<strong>Loyalty pattern of doctor:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Brand loyal: <br>
If a doctor is strongly loyal (almost 100% support) to a brand, then you have to find out the background information before trying to shift the brand.<br>
&#x2022; Company loyal: <br>
There are few doctors who prefer to prescribe almost all the products of a specific company. In this case, you should give priority of those products that are not available with that company.<br>
&#x2022; Brand shifter: <br>
These are the doctors who frequently shift brands. Be careful while taking commitment For SPS. Here you can for Therapeutic Category commitment e.g. he or she will prescribe NPL brands of anti-ulcerant rather than for Esotac or Rabetac or Ometac.<br><br>


<strong>Prospecting and Qualifying Case Study:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Sales of Pertilos and Pertilos-Plus is zero in your territory. You have following target: Pertilos 50 boxes and Pertilos-Plus — 40 boxes. Please present the prospecting and qualifying steps with respect to your territory.<br>
&#x2022; Trainer will select a territory in each group and others will use the real data of that territory to select right doctors
for these 2 products. They will justify why the doctors have been selected.<br><br>

<div class="a">
<strong>Step-3: Develop a Selling Strategy and Call Objectives:</strong><br>
<b>Physicians have 3 fears</b><br>
&#x2022; Their fear of their own lack of knowledge about the product<br>
&#x2022; Their fear of the TMO’s lack of knowledge about the product<br>
&#x2022; Their fear of being criticized for prescribing the product<br>
Usually, overcoming any two of the three fears will help overcome the third fear. Selling Strategy should be formulated to handle the above fears of the physician.<br><strong>1.3</strong><br><br>




<strong>Strategic Issues:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Sell yourself (to overcome fear about you)<br>
&#x2022; Sell company (to overcome fear about company and product)<br>
&#x2022; Sell product (to overcome fear about the product)<br>
&#x2022; Brand shifting or Molecule shifting<br>
&#x2022; Product Positioning<br>
&#x2022; Communication strategy<br>
&#x2022; Selling strategy<br><br>


<strong>Brand shifting or Molecule shifting:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Molecule shifting is knowledge based and preferred for long term benefits<br>
&#x2022; Brand shifting is expensive<br><br>


<strong>Product Positioning:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Positioning is the process of establishing an object in the minds of the target physicians in such a way that it is perceived to answer the needs of the target physicians.<br>
&#x2022; For example, we have positioned Joytrip as Drug of Choice in Motion Sickness.<br><br>


<strong>Communication strategy:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Detailing aids to be used<br>
&#x2022; Medico-marketing activities<br>
&#x2022; Visit frequency and Visit plan<br><br>


<strong>Selling strategy:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Shelving in relevant pharmacies<br>
&#x2022; Basic motivating factors of the doctor for prescribing the product<br>
&#8227; Regular visit with scientific information with respect to FAB of product<br>
&#8227; Regular visit with gift<br>
&#8227; Regular visit with sample<br>
&#8227; Regular visit by superior (AM/RM/HO personnel)<br>
&#8227; Company image<br>
&#8227; Common ground/weak point<br>
&#8227; Direct personal benefits<br>
&#x2022; Is there any get-keeper (attendance, nurse, assistance etc.)<br>
&#x2022; how to fight the competitor<br><br>


<strong>Marketing is a war</strong><br>
&#x2022; Marketing battles are fought inside the mind.<br>
&#x2022; Inside your own mind and inside the mind of your prospects, every day of the week.<br>
&#x2022; The mind is the battleground. A terrain that is tricky and difficult to understand.<br>
&#x2022; A marketing war is a totally intellectual war with a battleground that no one has ever seen. It can only be imagined in the mind, which makes marketing warfare one of the most difficult to learn.<br><br>


<strong>Basic war strategies:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Defensive warfare<br>
&#x2022; Offensive warfare<br>
&#x2022; Flanking warfare<br>
&#x2022; Guerrilla warfare<br><br>


<strong>Defensive warfare</strong><br>
&#x2022; Doctor X is a busy gastroenterologist and prescribing our Rabetac 100%. To maintain this support we should put all types of barrier for other companies.<br>
&#8227; Offering gifts in regular basis<br>
&#8227; Sharing all types of latest scientific information on rabeprazole<br>
&#8227; Sharing patient’s positive feedback<br>
&#8227; Frequent visits with Rabetac<br>
&#8227; Put every effort to convert him as an Advocate of Navana<br>
&#9734; This is a defensive strategy.<br>


<strong>Conditions for Defensive Attack:</strong><br>
&#9734; Doctor and Product selection should match with company objective and strategy<br>
&#9734; Expanding share to 20% or more is the most effective defensive strategy<br><strong>1.4</strong><br><br>



<strong> Offensive warfare:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Doctor X is a busy gastroenterologist and prescribing our Sompraz 100% against a sponsored overseas trip.<br>
&#9702; You are maintaining a good relationship with the doctor through highlighting our quality corporate and product image.<br>
&#9702; Your AM/RM and even HO personnel (PE/SM/BDM) are visiting this doctor on regular basis.<br>
&#9702; All of us are highlighting Esotac<br>
&#9702; For the next year, you got the permission to sponsor the trip and the doctor is now writing Esotac 100%<br>
&#8227; This is a Offensive Strategy.<br>


<strong>Conditions for Offensive Attack:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Doctor and Product selection should match with company objective and strategy<br>
&#x2022; There should be appropriate justification for offensive attack<br>
&#x2022; Should have prior approval from Top Management<br><br>


<strong>Flanking warfare:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Doctor X is a busy gastroenterologist and prescribing 4 brands of Esomeprazole including Esotid of Opsonin. Recently you have identified that Opsonin people left and there is no replacement. You have good relationship with the doctor, but he was not prescribing our Esotac. Under current situation, you have done the following:<br>
&#9702; Offering a gift (as per profile and liking of the doctor) on Esoatc<br>
&#9702; Asking your AM/RM to visit this doctor with special emphasis on Esotac.
&#9702; Highlight the problem of Opsonin (no visit, product unavailability etc) very technically<br>
&#9702; Highlight the quality and availability of Esotac<br>
&#9702; Do all the possible within the company policy to get the R.x of Esotac<br>
&#9702; Doctor now prescribes Esotac regularly instead of Esotid and he continue to prescribe even alter joining of new TMO of Opsonin.<br>
&#x2022; This is a Flanking Strategy.<br>
&#9702; We have attacked Opsonin with full strength and retained our position (doctor is prescribing Esotac even after joining of a new MPO of Opsonin)<br>


<strong>Conditions for Flanking Attack:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Doctor and Product selection should match with company objective and strategy<br>
&#x2022; There should be appropriate justification for flanking attack<br>
&#x2022; Should have prior approval from Top Management<br>
&#x2022; Should be made secretly<br><br>


<strong>Guerrilla warfare:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Doctor X is a busy gastroenterologist and prescribing 4 brands of Esomeprazole including Esotid of Opsonin. Recently you have identified that Esotid is short supply. You have good relationship with the doctor, but he was not prescribing our Esotac. You know, the doctor has strong commitment to Esotid. Under current situation, you have done the following: -<br>
&#9702; Highlight the unavailability of Esotid very technically to the doctor
&#9702; highlight the quality and availability of Esotac<br>
&#9702; Doctor now prescribes Esotac regularly instead of Esotid
a But the doctor again started to prescribe Esotid after being confirmed that the product is now available.<br>
&#x2022; This is a Guerrilla Strategy.<br>
We have attacked Opsonin with minimum resource for temporary benefit and could not retain our position.<br> 


<strong>Conditions for Guerrilla Attack:</strong><br>

&#x2022; Products should be available in chemist shelf<br>
&#x2022; There should be at least one RC in your territory<br>
&#x2022; Otherwise you will be treated as a Terrorist not as a Patriotic Guerrilla.<br><br>


<strong>Difference between Flanking and Guerrilla:</strong><br>
&#x2022; In Flanking, you have to attack with full strength and resource with full commitment to succeed and retain your position.<br>
&#x2022; Before commencing Flanking attack, be sure that you know the doctor very well and the competitor’s weaknesses also. Otherwise, you will make huge wastage of company resources.<br>
&#x2022; In Guerrilla, you will attack technically for short-term benefit with minimum resource.<br><br>


<strong>Sales Cycle:</strong><br>
&#x2022; The Sales Cycle is the time bctwen your first contact with your prospect and the time your sales is transacted.<br>
&#x2022; Only proper Marketing Effort can reduce the length of Sales Cycle.<br><strong>1.5</strong><br><br>



<strong>Sales Call Objective:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Never make a sales call without clear-cut objectives.<br>
&#x2022; Put the objectives for your sales call in writing.<br>
&#x2022; Considering the Selling Strategy for the physician, your objective will be different for different sales calls e.g. <br>
&#9702; in one call you may try to sell the company; and<br>
&#9702; in another call you may share information for a specific disease to build awareness for the targct product<br>

<strong>Sales calls are different from Prospecting and Qualifying Calls</strong><br>
&#x2022; During the Sales Call our objective is to get prescription support in favor of specific target product as per
expectation.<br>
&#x2022; Whereas in case of Prospecting or Qualifying Call, we try to collect information as much as possible regarding the physician and build a rapport with the physician.<br><br>


<strong>Organizing Detailing Bag:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Organize the bag for smooth detailing considering the following factors:<br>
&#9702; Call objective<br>
&#9702; Product mix and sequence<br>
&#9702; Number of CC to be offered<br>
&#9702; PPM sequence<br>
&#9702; Gift<br>
&#x2022; All the promotional items should be properly organized to ensure professional detailing.<br><br>

<div class="a">
<strong>Step-4: Make the approach:</strong><br>
Gain the attention and interest of the prospect using the need benefit match selected above.<br>
&#x2022; Remember: People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.<br>
&#x2022; Your major goal in Approach is to help your prospects make a positive decision about you, the salesperson.<br><br>

<strong>Approaching</strong><br>
<b>Introduce yourself, and include these five elements.</b><br>
I .Greeting your Doctor<br>
2.Calling your Doctor appropriately<br>
3.Giving your own name<br>
4. Identifying your company<br>
5. Asking an open ended, rapport building question<br><br>

<b>Build rapport, using these seven interpcrsonal techniques:</b><br>
&#x2022; Smile<br>
&#x2022; Develop a genuine interest in people<br>
&#x2022; Talk in terms of the other person’s interests<br>
&#x2022; Give compliments<br>
&#x2022; Listen<br>
&#x2022; Make the other person feel important.<br>
To sell yourself, let your prospects do the talking. The more your prospects talk, the more they’ll like you.<br>
Make a great first impression<br>
&#x2022; Humans tend to make very quick judgment about people on first meeting them.<br>
&#x2022; Those first few seconds and minutes are crucial, and if you make a bad impression, it can take a lot of work to
rectify.<br>

<b>Make a great first impression</b><br>
&#x2022; Smile!<br>
&#x2022; Make eye contact<br>
&#x2022; Dress smartly<br>
&#x2022; Small talk.<br>

&#x2022; Get a business card (for new doctor)<br>
<b>Dress smartly</b><br>
&#x2022; Dress according to your position<br>
&#x2022; Dress for your clients<br>
&#x2022; But never dress in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable<br><strong>1.6</strong><br><br>

<div class="a">
<strong>Step-5: Make the presentation:</strong><br>

<b>Presentation means Detailing</b><br>
&#x2022; Most frequently used <b>Detailing Aids</b> are Literature, Pad, and Gift.<br>
&#x2022; In most cases, a Literature highlights a <b>Medical Treatment Problem (MTP)</b> and gives solution to the problem by highlighting the <b>Features, Advantages and Bcnefits</b> of the products.<br>
&#x2022; To attract the attention of the physician, marketers frequently use different pictures, graphics and these are called <b>Visualization</b>. Use of visualization, is based on the theory of <b>AIDCA</b>.<br> 
&#x2022; AIDCA stands for Attention, Interest, Desire, Conviction and Action<br><br>

<b>AIDCA:</b><br>
&#x2022; ATTRACTING ATTENTION<br>
&#x2022; DEVELOPING INTEREST<br>
&#x2022; INSPIRING DESIRE<br>
&#x2022; CREATING CONVICTION<br>
&#x2022; INCITING ACTION<br><br>

<b>FAB:</b><br>
&#x2022; Features: <br>
Built-in aspect or performance of the product. Floxacin syp has diluent for reconstitution.<br>
&#x2022; Benefits: <br>
What the customer gains by using the product. Patient can prepare Floxacin syp quickly and properly with exact concentration.<br>
&#x2022; Advantage: <br>
This is comparative. This is an additional feature with respect to comparing products. Floxacin syp ensure more patient compliance than ---- brand.<br><br>

<b>Literature Structure</b><br>
&#x2022; 1st Page: <br>
Visualization of Medical Treatment Problem (MTP)<br>
&#x2022; 2nd Page: <br>
Solution of MTP, Brand Introduction, Mechanism of Action (where applicable), FAB<br>

&#x2022; 4th Page: <br>
Summary of Benefits/PI/References<br><br>

<b>Literature Handling</b><br>
&#x2022; Don’t offer the literature to doctor before completion of detailing<br>
&#x2022; Shift one page to another page smartly<br>
&#x2022; Use pen to point figure or text or picture<br>
&#x2022; Maintain appropriate distance for better show<br>
&#x2022; Practice the literature for better handling<br>
&#x2022; Pronunciation should be correct<br>
&#x2022; Reference should be highlighted properly as applicable<br><br>

<b>Customization of Detailing</b><br>
&#x2022; Doctor’s Loyalty Status (Prospect/FTC/RC/Client/Advocatc)<br>
&#x2022; Doctor’s specialization<br>
&#x2022; Customer profile<br>

&#x2022; Summary of Benefits<br>
&#x2022; Trial Closing (can be skipped if closing has been made against each FAB)<br>
&#x2022; Closing<br><strong>3.1</strong><br><br>

<strong>Buying Signal:</strong><br>
&#x2022; When buyers are ready to buy, they will tell you, but not with words.<br>
&#x2022; They will, however, send loud non-verbal signals.<br>
&#x2022; All you need to do is be able to read them.<br><br>

<strong>When they are NOT ready to buy:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Avoiding eye contact with you<br>
&#x2022; Making 'not now' excuses<br>
&#x2022; Casual handling of the product<br>
&#x2022; Looking at many different products<br>
&#x2022; Moving around quickly<br>
&#x2022; Talking about irrelevant issues<br><br>

<strong>When they are ready to buy:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Spending time looking at one product type<br>
&#x2022; Looking around for somebody to help them<br>
&#x2022; Asking questions about the detail<br>
&#x2022; Asking about price<br>
&#x2022; Using possession language<br>
&#x2022; Asking another person’s opinion<br>
&#x2022; Body state changes<br><br>

<strong>Double Call</strong><br>
&#x2022; TMO will introduce the accompanying person properly with exact purpose of visit.<br>
&#x2022; It is Senior’s responsibility to establish the purpose clearly before entering the chamber.<br>
&#x2022; TMO will detail first<br>
&#x2022; Senior will observe and evaluate<br>
&#x2022; Senior will give feedback after the call outside the chamber<br>
&#x2022; Senior will rescue ONLY when:<br>
&#8227; There is a serious error affecting professional life of doctor<br>
&#8227; Information will affect the patient<br>
&#8227; The information is a violation of company policy<br>

&#x2022; Senior will talk ONLY after completion of detailing<br>
&#x2022; Senior will limit his discussion within the stated purpose<br><br>

<div class="a">
<strong>Step-6: Trial Close:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Test close on a minor point to see if the prospect is accepting the benefits and is ready to buy.<br>
<b>TRIAL CLOSE</b><br>
&#x2022; <b>A trial close is testing the waters, while closing the sale is getting the commitment.</b><br>
&#x2022; A Trial Close is not a normal ‘closing technique’ but a test to determine whether the person is. ready to close.<br>
&#x2022; Use it after a presentation or after you have made a strong selling point.<br>
&#x2022; Use it when you have answered objections.<br>
&#x2022; When you have asked the Trial Close question, as with most other closes, be quiet, watch and listen carefully for their response.<br>
&#x2022; Ask Closed Ended Questions.<br>
<b>Common Trial Close Questions</b><br>
&#x2022; Am I right sir/madam?<br>
&#x2022; Do you agree with me sir/madam?<br>
&#x2022; Is it important for your patients?<br>
&#x2022; Do you feel it important?<br>
&#x2022; Will you consider it important?<br><strong>3.2</strong><br><br>

<strong>Selling by Question</strong><br>
&#x2022; Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning.<br>
—Albert Einstein, German—born physicist<br>
<strong>Questioning is a powerful tool</strong><br>
&#x2022; if we’re agreed that telling isn’t selling, then what is it that we should be doing instead?<br>
&#x2022; The answer is that we should be making every effort to engage the prospect in a <span>dialogue</span>.<br>
&#8227; asking questions and<br>
&#8227; listening to their answers<br>
&#x2022; These two skills are fundamental to the art of successful selling in most business contexts.<br><br>

<b>Two general types of questions</b><br>
&#x2022; Open Questions begin with How, Why, When, Where and What. The clicit information, because you cannot simply answer with a Yes or No.<br>
&#8227; How do you treat MDR typhoid?<br>
&#8227; What drug do you consider as the best option for----?<br>
&#8227; When do you suggest BID instead of OD?<br>
&#8227; Where are you going for the seminar?<br>
&#x2022; Closed Questions can only be answered with Yes or No. They’re effective when you want to test an assumption, control the dialogue or qualify an answer. Closed questions start with “Will you....” "Did you...." "Does" "Are You" I ‘Is it.<br><strong>3.3</strong><br><br>

<div class="a">
<strong>Step-7: Handling objections</strong><br>
&#x2022; Accept objections as form of feedback.<br>
&#x2022; Clarify needs and provide proof that the product benefits will meet the needs.<br><br>

<b>Handling an objection is an integral part of the selling process.</b><br>
&#x2022; Rarely can you find sales taking place without objections.<br>
&#x2022; Objections are really the response to the sales presentation. It shows us that the prospect has been touched emotionally.<br>
&#x2022; Objections are not rejections and should not be taken personally.<br>
&#x2022; To a well-prepared professional, every objection is an opportunity to close.<br>
&#x2022; On hearing an objection, a good professioiial feels encouraged because this is his opportunity to convince and use his time-tested principles of selling.<br>
&#x2022; All Objections and Responses Can and Should Be Anticipated<br>
&#x2022; A good professional should be prepared in advanceto prevent objections.<br><br>

<b>Objections, Conditions and Excuses<br>
Objection: Related to FAB</b><br>
&#x2022; When a buyer raises an objection he is really saying, ‘I am not convinced yet. If I get convinced, probably I will prescribe your product.<br>
&#x2022; Example: Your claim of 100% success rate is not convincing.<br><br>

<b>A condition is a circunistance that cannot be changed and prevents the buyer from making a purchase.</b><br>
&#x2022; No matter how good a salesperson I am, a condition cannot be changed and I cannot sell.<br>
&#x2022; Example: Until and unless your product is available in Govt. supply, I cannot prescribe. (raised by Indoor doctor).<br><br>

<b>Excuses related to hidden objection</b><br>
&#x2022; Sometimes, a resistance is voiced and sometimes it’s not. The worst kind of objection one has is the one that is not brought out in the open, or hidden resistance — the one that actually prevents the doctor from prescribing your products, but which is not verbalized. Some hidden objections
maybe:<br>
&#8227; Sometimes, a Chemist shop (or Clinic) based doctor could not prescribe a product until the Chemist (or owner of the clinic) gives a signal.<br>
&#8227; The doctor is committed to give 100% support to another brand.<br>
&#8227; The doctor is annoyed with previous TMO’s behavior<br>
&#8227; The doctor is not convinced about the quality of the product<br><br>

<b>In case of hidden objections, The most important thing is to find out the real objection.</b><br>
&#x2022; Whenever there is a hesitation from the prospect (doctor), it is very crucial to understand what is going through his mind. One needs to probe further, tactfully.<br>
&#x2022; Some examples of probing questions are:<br>

&#8227; My AM/RM Sir would like to visit you on next Saturday? Would you please allow him to discuss about Esotac?<br>
&#8227; Dear Sir/Madam, you have lot of scope to prescribe Esomeprazole. But I am getting not a single Rx of our Esotac. Would you please tell me what goes wrong with Esotac? (before asking this question, be sure that the doctor is not committed 100% to any brand).<br>
&#8227; It would be a great honor for us to have Rx of Esotac from you. Would you please give me an opportunity?<br><strong>2.1</strong><br><br>


<strong>Objection-handling process:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Listen<br>
&#x2022; Question<br>
&#9702; Confirm the objection<br>
&#9702; Isolate the objection<br>
&#x2022; Think<br>
&#x2022; Handle<br>
&#x2022; Check<br>
&#x2022; Then go for the close<br><br>

<b>Listen</b><br>
&#x2022; Stop! Do not try to jump in at the beginning - this may cause further objection. When you interrupt them, you are objecting to their objection. If you refuse to listen, then their next steps may well be towards the door.<br>

&#x2022; Use active listening methods, nodding and physically showing interest.<br>
&#x2022; They are trying to tell you something that will help you sell to them, which is a gift from them to you. If you do not listen, then their next step may well be towards the door.<br><br>

<b>Question</b><br>
&#x2022; As appropriate, ask some questions. This not only shows you are interested in them, but it also gives you more information with which to make the sale. As you question them, watch carefully
for body language that gives you more information about what they are thinking and feeling.<br>
&#x2022; Remember that this is not an interrogation, and that giving them the ‘third degree’ will turn them off. So keep your questions light and relevant.<br>
&#x2022; You might also tip the bucket at this time, asking them if there are any more concerns (=objections) that they have, and which, if you can resolve them, you might gain a close.<br>
&#x2022; It is not always necessary to ask questions.<br><br>

<b>Think</b><br>
&#x2022; Now before you dive into objection-handling, think!<br>
&#x2022; What methods will work best with them?<br>
&#x2022; Should you take a direct and confrontational approach or should you use the soft-soap to finesse the situation?<br>
&#x2022; Or maybe you should put it off to another day (but only if you can be sure that you can return to the selling situation).<br>
&#x2022; Thinking is a good thing where you are adding a little pause into the proceedings, thus demonstrating how you are taking their objection seriously.<br><br>

<b>Handle</b><br>
&#x2022; This stage may sometimes only be a few seconds after they object or it may require more time in the previous three steps.<br>
&#x2022; Now, when you are ready, use the objection-handling method that you believe will work best. Or make up your own.<br>
&#x2022; You are under no obligation to try and force-fit a method where it is unlikely to work.<br><br>

<b>Check</b><br>
&#x2022; Finally, check to find out whether your objection-handling worked!<br>
&#x2022; Ask if you have answered their question.<br>
&#x2022; Ask if there are any more concerns.<br>
&#x2022; As necessary, handle outstanding objections.<br>
&#x2022; Then go for the close.<br><strong>2.2</strong><br><br>

<div class="a">
<strong>Step-8: Conclude presentation and close:</strong><br>
When a sufticient number of benefits have been accepted. the sales person will to move to close on the goal of the call, which may he a demonstration or the order.<br><br>

<strong>Closing</strong><br>
&#x2022; <b>A closing is a natural outcome of a good presentation.</b><br>
&#x2022; Selling can be a lot like fly fishing.<br>
&#x2022; If you tug hard on the line. it will snap and the fish will get away.<br>
&#x2022; The best method is a gentle coaxing that gradually brings the fish in to shore - although sometimes when they are spooked you have to let them out again and calm them down further away.<br><br>

<strong>ABC</strong><br>
&#x2022; ‘ABC’ is a common abbreviation: Always Be Closing.<br>

&#x2022; It means that you should always be heading towards a close, although you must also be careful about over-doing this.<br>
&#x2022; If people are nowhere near ready to buy, this will just annoy them.<br><br>

<strong>Assumptive Close</strong><br>
Technique<br>
&#x2022; Act as if the other person has made the decision already.<br>
&#x2022; Turn the focus of the conversation towards the next level of questions, such as how many they want, when they want it delivered, what size they need, and so on.<br>

<strong>Examples</strong><br>
<i>&#9702; Would you please give an order of 10 boxes today? (applicable ONLY for DCC or PC)<br>
&#9702; Would you please recommend your Pharmacy to place order? (applicable ONLY for hospitals or clinics where pharmacy places order on recommendation of the indoor doctors)</i><br><br>

<strong>Calendar Close</strong><br>
Technique<br>
&#x2022; If they are not ready to close now, agree a future date when you can meet to discuss further This at least keeps the deal alive and you return to fight another day. It may also be just what you are seeking to take you to the next step in the deal strategy.<br>
&#x2022; Putting dates in the diary may also be an assumptive method, assuming that closure has taken place and that it is just a matter of when.<br>

<strong>Examples</strong><br>
&#9702; <i>I will bring all rferences on next Sunday to explain the mechanism of action in detail.</i> <br><br>

<strong>Compliment Close</strong><br>
Technique<br>
&#x2022; Be nice to them. Tell them how wonderful they are. Be amazed and impressed by them.<br>
&#x2022; Cast them as the expert so they sell to themselves. Tell them how good. they look or sound.<br>
&#x2022; Tell them how others will be impressed by them. Tell them how impressed you are with them as a person. Admire their integrity.<br>
&#x2022; Then ask for the sale.<br>
<strong>Examples</strong><br>
&#9702; <i>Dear Sir/Madam, ONLY you have the scope to prescribe such a sophisticated drug. I have made the product available in nearby pharmacies considering your scope. May I expect the 1st prescription from you?<br>
For complicated UTI, patients reply on you and our drug can cure the complicated UTI. So may I expect prescription in favor of X from next available patient?</i><br><strong>4.1</strong><br><br>


<strong>Conditional close</strong><br>
Technique<br>
&#x2022; When the other person offers an objection, make it a condition of resolving their objection that they make the purchase.<br>
&#x2022; Always, by the way, phrase it in the form ‘If I...will you...’ rather than ‘Will you..if I...’. This is because our brains work very quickly and starting with ‘will you’ causes them to begin thinking immediately about objections and they may miss the exchange. On the other hand, starting with If I...’ will cause psychological closure on what you are offering thus drawing them in to the close.<br>
<strong>Examples</strong><br>
&#x2022; <i>As you suggested us to launch Esotac capsule, we are going to introduce Esotac in Capsule form in this week. May I request...... prescription per day in favor of our Esotac
capsule?<br>
&#x2022; If we change the presentation of our......product,  may I have your Rx support in favor of our........ ?
&#x2022; If I can justify the 100% efficacy of.....in complicated UTI, may I expect your100% support for...... in case of complicated UTI?</i><br><br>

<strong>Demonstration Close</strong><br>
Technique<br>
&#x2022; if you are able to, do a spectacular demonstration of your product that really makes them ‘wow’.<br>
&#x2022; If you can’t do it with them there (which is by far and away the best), then use a video or otherwise add impact.<br>
&#x2022; Give them a go. Let them try and find out for themselves.<br>
<strong>Examples</strong><br>
&#x2022; <i>if you allow me. I would like to request you to have a taste of our chewcee. I am confident that you will find it as the best in term of taste. (.... After completion of Demo---- )May I request------Rx in favor of Chewcee?</i><br>
&#x2022; You can see (showing the accessories of product) we have provided spoon, measuring cup and dropper in our....... for the conveniences of your patients in all age groups. <i>May I request----Rx in favor of------?</i><br><br>

<strong>Emotion Close</strong><br>
<strong>Technique</strong><br>
&#x2022; Play to their emotions. deliberately evoking specific emotions.<br>
&#x2022; Find if they respond more to positive or negative emotions and act accordingly.<br>
&#x2022; If in doubt, go for positive emotions - these are usually better.<br>
<strong>Examples</strong><br>
&#x2022; <i>Today we are celebrating Esotac Mother’s Day. I have a target of 20 Rx today. Without yur support I could not achieve this target. Would you please give me at least 10 Rx for Esotac today?</i><br><br>

<strong>Summary Close</strong><br>
<strong>Technique</strong><br>
&#x2022; Summarize the list of benefits that the other person will receive, telling them the full extent of what they are getting for their money.<br>
&#x2022; Make it sound impressive, using full phrases and attractive words.<br>
<strong>Examples</strong><br>
Esotac Capsule offers:<br>
-----
-----
Considering all these benefits. may I expect----- Rx of Esotac Capsule from you?<br><strong>4.2</strong><br><br>


<strong>Testimonial Close</strong><br>
<strong>Technique</strong><br>
&#x2022; Use a happy customer to convince the other person.<br>
&#x2022; Show them letters from happy customers. Have the letters on the wall.<br>
&#x2022; If you are using the name of the happy customer, make sure they agree to you doing this. Otherwise you will have to use an anonymous reference. such as ‘satisfied customer from
Birmingham’ or ‘major airline’.<br>
&#x2022; Persuade happy customers act as references, that the other person can either call up or they can visit. Reward the happy customer with appropriate thanks, which may range from a simple letter to a small present to a discount. Be very careful here to ensure the customer feels valued and does not feel they are being bribed.<br>
<strong>Examples</strong><br>
- In last Scientific Scminar, Professor X told that Rabeprazole should be the drug of choice for-----(disease). You have a large number of patients with------. May I expect
----- Rx of Rabetac daily?<br><br>

<strong>A CLOSE is NOT A CLOSE</strong><br>
&#x2022; It’s not actually true that you “close” a sale. This term gives beginning salespeople the impression that once they have closed, they have finished the transaction.<br>
&#x2022; Veteran salespeople know that a close really means the opening----and opportunity ---- a new cycle of business.<br><strong>4.3</strong><br><br>


<div class="a">
<strong>Step-9: Follow-up:</strong><br>
&#x2022; Prepare for a demonstration, complete the order forms, analyze the call, and complete the customer records.<br>
&#x2022; After getting the commitment from the doctor to prescribe your product, you must make Post-call <b>prescription survey</b> to confirm that he or she has prescribed your product.<br>
&#x2022; If yes, you should try to your best to convert the prescription into sales and order.<br>
&#x2022; On the other hand, you should thank the doctor in your next visit to keep the <b>Sales Cycle</b> on and convert the doctor to an <b>Advocate</b>.<br><br>

<b>Loyal customers are your company’s most valuable asset.</b><br>
&#x2022; On the other hand, you should <br>
<strong>What to do: First Time Customer to Repeat Customer</strong><br>
&#x2022; Close monitoring<br>
&#x2022; Customer support (from company representative in the field and also from Head Office)
&#x2022; Be credible and build personal relationship<br>
&#x2022; Competitor reaction follow-up and act promptly<br><br>

<strong>What to do: Repeat Customer to Client</strong><br>
&#x2022; Proper product selection<br>
&#x2022; Strong support from Head Office senior management<br>
&#x2022; Involving customer into medico-marketing activities or corporate promotional campaign<br><br>
<b>Multiproduct Detailing</b><br>
&#x2022; FTC products (if it is a focus product for the doctor) with complements and feedback to reinforce prescription.<br>
&#x2022; New Product with Literature (if any)<br>
&#x2022; New Information (literature) of old products (RC products)<br>
&#x2022; Reminder with sample (1st RC then Prospect><br>
&#x2022; Gift for RC products<br>
&#x2022; <b>Sequence may be customized ONLY if there is any other valid reason</b><br><br>

<strong>What to do: Client to Advocate</strong><br>
&#x2022; Corporate image building campaign<br>
&#x2022; Medico-marketing activities<br>
&#x2022; Trust based relationship of doctor with senior management<br><br>

<strong>Product Development versus Product Establishment</strong><br>
&#x2022; <b>Product Development:</b><br>
Rx and Sales of a Product is growing day by day and month to month.<br>
&#x2022; <b>Product Establishment:</b><br>
Rx share of a product is significantly high (e.g. 25% Rx share enjoying 3rd position) and the product is available in all the important chemist shops. There are repeat orders from these chemists.<br><br>

<strong>How to make our life easy?</strong><br>
&#x2022; By developing client and advocate as many as possible in your territory<br>
&#x2022; By establishing products as many as possible in your territory<br><br>

<strong>DETAILING</strong><br>
&#x2022; Show the Video of Detailing<br>
&#x2022; Criticize and tips for ideal detailing<br>
&#x2022; Detailing Practice<br><br>

<strong>Selling is a Rejection Business</strong><br>
&#x2022; Don’t take it as personal<br>
&#x2022; Identify your mistakes and take corrective measures<br>
&#x2022; Find out the opportunity<br>
&#x2022; Set small goals and proceed in steps to reach to the ultimate goal<br><strong>5.1</strong><br><br>

<strong>WITH THE SAME PRODUCT AND UNDER THE SAME & CIRCUMSTANCES THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO BREAK RECORDS WHILE OTHERS BREAK THEMSELVES.</strong><br>
&#x2022; Negative emotions like fear, hate, jealousy and anger result in internal battles that drain us of our
energy.<br>
&#x2022; Fear of failure is worse than failure itself. In fact, it drags a person to failure.<br>
&#x2022; Winners do things in spite of problems.<br>
&#x2022; Losers permanently rationalize in life and make excuses. They are the moaner, groaners and complainers. They always wait for things to happen, they never make things happen.<br><br>

<strong>Selling in Pharmaceutical Industry is based on long-term relationship</strong><br>
<b>The psychology of relationships in selling</b><br>
&#x2022; A quality relationship is built with a solid foundation.<br>
&#x2022; In the foundation, there are four major bricks.<br>
&#8227; Credibility<br>
&#8227; Trust<br>
&#8227; Common Ground<br>
&#8227; Communication<br><br>

<strong>The Credibility Brick</strong><br>
&#x2022; Credibility is the basis for how new relationships are started in the sales process.<br>
&#x2022; Credibility begins with you understanding your potential customer, their situation, market and possible
struggles.<br>
&#x2022; Being credible is a process not a single event.<br>
&#x2022; It is a practice of consistency.<br>
&#x2022; it takes time to build credibility but only a short while to break it down.<br><br>

<strong>The Trust Brick</strong><br>
&#x2022; Trust and credbitity are often confused. They are mutually exclusive, but codependent in nature.<br>
&#x2022; The earlier you build trust the quicker you’ll move the sale forward.<br>
&#x2022; As with credibility, trust is not an event but a process.<br>
&#x2022; You develop it with each correspondence you have either verbally or written.<br>
&#x2022; Sales are often lost due to a lack of trust felt by the buyer.<br><br>

<strong>The Common Ground Brick</strong><br>
&#x2022; Relationships happen because there is a connection. in most cases, connections are made because two people share something in common.<br>
&#x2022; Your responsibility as a sales professional is to find that commonality. The quicker you can find the common bond the sooner you’ll solidify the relationship.<br>
&#x2022; Common ground usually starts with basic things like children, sports, activities, special interests, etc.<br>
&#x2022; Be cautious to find common ground with the taboo topics like religion or politics.<br>
&#x2022; “Must one have common ground to make a sale?” The answer is, No. However, if you want to build and maintain long-term relationships, developing a common ground bond is an important key.<br>
Common Ground<br><br>

<strong>The Communication Process</strong><br>
&#x2022; Communication is the process of passing information and understanding from one person to another.<br>
&#x2022; The communication process involves six basic elements:<br>
&#8227; sender (encoder)<br>
&#8227; message<br>
&#8227; channel<br>
&#8227; receiver (decoder)<br>
&#8227; noise, and<br>
&#8227; feedback<br><strong>5.2</strong><br><br>


&#8227; You should improve communication skills by becoming aware of these elements and how they contribute to successful communication.<br>
&#8227; Communication can break down at any one of these elements.<br><br>

<strong>The Communication Brick</strong><br>
&#8227; Perception is reality<br>
&#8227; Don’t beat around the bush<br>
&#8227; Say what you mean and mean what you say<br>
&#8227; Under promise; over deliver<br>
&#8227; Actions speak louder than words<br><br>

<strong>Common Time Traps for Salesmen</strong><br>
&#8227; Poor planning of the day’s activities.<br>
&#x2022; Calling on unqualified prospects.<br>
&#x2022; Following a haphazard travel schedule.<br>
&#x2022; Insufficient use of the telephone.<br>
&#x2022; Taking long lunch breaks.<br>
&#x2022; Inefficiency in paperwork.<br>
&#x2022; Putting in a short day’s work.<br>
&#x2022; Taking off early on Thursday’s afternoons.<br>
&#x2022; Spending too much time talking.<br>
&#x2022; Taking too many coffee breaks.<br>
&#x2022; Inefficient use of waiting time.<br>
&#x2022; Entertaining customers too much.<br>
&#x2022; Staying out of touch for too long with the Head Office as a result of which important messages get delayed.<br><br>

<strong>FORMULA FOR SUCCESS</strong><br>
&#x2022; Be passionate about the profession of selling.<br>
&#x2022; Believe in your product.<br>
&#x2022; Believe in your company.<br>
&#x2022; Believe in being a good professional by practicing integrity.<br>
&#x2022; There is no substitute for hard work.<br>
&#x2022; Practice persistence, don’t quit.<br>
&#x2022; Be a possibility thinker. Always look at possibilities and potential. Be optimistic.<br>
&#x2022; Be knowledgeable about your product, service and industry.<br>
&#x2022; Get on a continuous education program.<br>
&#x2022; Evaluate your performance, daily, weekly, monthly and with each evaluation, note three positive things you are doing and three things you need to improve until the next evaluation.<br>
&#x2022; Reinforce the positive and replace the negative.<br>
&#x2022; Wise people learn from their mistakes but wiser people learn from others’ mistakes.<br>
&#x2022; Be enthusiastic — it shows belief in your product and in your profession.<br>
&#x2022; Empathize with your prospect. Put yourself in the other persons shoes.<br><br>

<strong>Change for the Best</strong><br>
&#x2022; There is an old saying — ‘If you keep doing what you have always been doing, you will keep getting what you have always been getting. Expecting different results is defined as insanity.<br>
&#x2022; If we expect different results then it stands to reason that we need to change the input because input determines output.<br>
<b>Let’s Change to get better result.</b><br>
