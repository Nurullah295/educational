<b>1. Diabetes Mellitus:</b><br>
A disease in which the body's ability to produce or respond to the hormone insulin is impaired, resulting in abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates and elevated levels of glucose in the blood.<br><br>

<b>2. Diabetic Diarrhoea:</b><br>
Diabetic diarrhoea is a troublesome gastrointestinal complication of diabetes. This condition persists for several weeks to months and it frequently accompanies foecal incontinence.<br><br>

<b>3. Diabetic ketoacidosis:</b><br>
Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones. The condition develops when body can't produce enough insulin.<br><br>
