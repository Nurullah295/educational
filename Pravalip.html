<b>Model Detail Talk (Launching Lit):</b><br>

Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
In your daily practice, you may get many patients who are suffering from hypercholesterolemia and dyslipidemia. Cholesterol lowering therapy should be targeted at a treatment goal of LDL cholesterol less than 2.5mmol/L. Am I right Sir/Madam?<br><br>



Sir/Madam, "A statin in need is a statin indeed"<br><br>

Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
In high-risk patients, according to the Adult Treatment Panel III
(ATPIII) guidelines on cholesterol management, cholesterol
lowering therapy should be targeted at a treatment goal of LDL
cholesterol less than 2.5mmol/L.<br>

Therefore, when the expected 25 - 34% of LDL cholesterol lowering will be enough to reach an LDL < 2.5 mmol/L and safety is a major concern, treatment should be started with Pravastatin.<br>

Pravastatin reduces total cholesterol by 25 - 34% with a very consistent risk reduction of 24% of death from cardiovascular diseases, with RARE SIDE EFFECTS<br>

Sir/Madam,<br>
Navana introduces Pravalip (A preparation of Pravastatin), First time in Bangladesh.<br>
"A star statin with better safety"<br><br>
FAB:1<br>
Causes minimum adverse effects compared to Atorvastatin From clinical study it has been found that more patients in the atorvastatin group had elevations in alanine aminotransferases levels three times than pravastatin group<br>
(3.3 Vs 1.1% respectively).<br>
No dose adjustment required in patients with renal failure.<br>

Discontinuation rate due to elevations of creatine kinase levels were Pravastatin group (2.71%) than more in Atorvastatin group (3.3%). So, no adverse effects on muscle enzymes.<br><br>

FAB:2<br>
Sir/Madam, Pravalip reduces 24 % coronary heart disease mortality & reduces 29% myocardial infarction. In another study, Paravalip reduces 32% from cardiovascular death.<br>
Help reduce CV death.<br>

Pravalip is very effective treatment option for controlling hyperlipidaemia because Pravalip increases HDL-C more than Atorvastatin (8.1% Vs 6.5%).<br>
Effective treatment option for controlling hyperlipidaemia.<br><br>


Summary benefits:<br>
&#x2022; Less chance of Liver & Muscle damage.<br>
&#x2022; No dose adjustment required in patients with renal failure.<br>
&#x2022; Helps reduce CV death.<br>
&#x2022; Reduces the possibility of drug interaction.<br><br>

Sir,<br>
Considering all these benefits, may I expect only one 01 prescription in favour of our Pravalip?<br>
Sir,<br>
Here is a literature for your further information. Thanks for patience hearing.<br>
Thank you Sir/Madam<br><br>


<b>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):</b><br>
<b>1. What is Pravalip (Pravastatin)?</b><br>
Ans: Pravalip (Pravastatin) is a statin used to lower cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. Pravalip is the safest statin than Atorvastatin, Rosuvastatin & Simvastatin due to its less side effect.<br><br>

<b>2. What is the dose of Pravalip for patients with renal or hepatic impairment?</b><br>
Ans: Pravalip is the safest statin than Atorvastatin & Rosuvastatin for hepatic & renally compromised patients. The recommended starting dose is 40 mg once daily. In patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal diseas (CrCl less than 30 mL/min) the recommended dosage is 10 mg once daily.<br><br>

<b>3. Why pravalip is safe for hepatic patients than Atorvastatin?</b><br>
Ans: As Atorvastatin increases alanine aminotransferase levels three times the Pravastatin group (3.3 Vs 1.19 respectively) & discontinuation rate due to elevations of creatine kinase levels were Pravastatin group (2.71%) than more in Atorvastatin group (3.3%).<br><br>
	
<b>4. Why Pravalip is safer for Kidney patients than Atorvastatin?</b><br>
Ans: From the administered dose of Pravastatin, about 70% is eliminated in the feces while about 20% is eliminated in the urine.<br>
<br>
	
<b>5. How does Pravalip help reduce myalgia?</b><br>
Ans: Because Pravalip does not increase muscle enzyme (creatine kinase). So, there is no chance to develop myalgia.<br><br>

<b>6. Does Pravastatin reduce the risk of CV events?</b><br>
Ans: Pravastatin reduces 24% coronary heart disease mortality & 29% Myocardial infarction.<br><br>

<b>7. Does Pravastatin increase HDL cholesterol more than Atorvastatin?</b><br>
Ans: Pravastatin increases HDL cholesterol 8.1% whereas Atorvastatin ensures only 6.5%.<br>
<br>
	
<b>8. Is Pravastatin safe for pregnancy & Lactation?</b><br>
Ans: Pravastatin is not recommended during pregnancy & Lactation.<br><br>

<b>9. Is Pravastatin safe for children?</b><br>
Ans: Pravastatin is safe above 8 years of age.<br><br>

<b>10. How does Pravalip help reduce drug-drug interaction?</b><br>
Ans: Most of the statins are metabolized through cytochrome P450 metabolic pathway like Atorvastatin, Simvastatin. In contrast, Pravastatin does not depend on this enzymatic pathway.<br><br>

<b>11. Metabolism process of Pravastatin is?</b><br>
Ans: The metabolism process of Pravastatin is glucuronidation reactions(CYP3A enzyme).<br><br>

Note:<br>
Acetoacetyl CoA:<br>
Acetoacetyl CoA is the precursor of HMG-CoA in the mevalonate pathway, which is essential for cholesterol biosynthesis. It also takes a similar role in the ketone bodies synthesis (ketogenesis) pathway of the liver.[1] In the ketone bodies digestion pathway (in the tissue), it is no longer associated with having HMG-CoA as a product or as a reactant.<br>
HMG-CoA:<br>
β-Hydroxy β-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA), also known as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A, is an intermediate in the mevalonate and ketogenesis pathways. It is formed from acetyl CoA and acetoacetyl CoA by HMG-CoA synthase. The research of Minor J. Coon and Bimal Kumar Bachhawat in the 1950s at University of Illinois led to its discovery.<br><br>

<b>Prescribing information:</b><br>
<b>Composition:</b><br>
Pravalip 10 Tablet:<br>
Each tablet contains Pravastatin Sodium BP 10 mg.<br>

Pravalip 20 Tablet:<br>
Each tablet contains Pravastatin Sodium BP 20 mg.<br>

<b>Pharmacology:</b><br>
Pravastatin is a reversible inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early and rate limiting step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol. In addition, Pravastatin reduces VLDL and TG and increases HDL-C.<br>

<b>Indications:</b><br>
Pravalip is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) indicated as an adjunctive therapy to diet to: reduce the risk of Myocardial Infarction (MI), revascularization, and cardiovascular mortality in hypercholesterolemic patients without clinically evident Coronary Heart Disease(CHD) reduce the risk of total mortality by reducing coronary death, Myocardial Infarction (MI), revascularization, stroke/Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), and the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with clinically evident Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). reduce elevated Total Cholesterol (TC), Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C), Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and Triglycerides (TG) levels and to increase High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia. reduce elevated serum Triglycerides (TG) levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. treat patients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia who are not responding to diet. treat children and adolescent patients ages 8 years and older with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia after failing an adequate trial of diet therapy. <br>

<b>Dosage & Administration: </b><br>
Adults:<br>
The recommended starting dose is 40 mg once daily. Use 80 mg dose
only for patients not reaching LDL-C goal with 40 mg.<br>

<b>Significant renal impairment: </b><br>
The recommended starting dose of Pravastatin is 10 mg once daily. 

<b>Children (ages 8 to 13 years): </b><br>
The recommended starting dose is 20 mg once daily.<br>

<b>Adolescents (ages 14 to 18 years):</b><br>
The recommended starting cose is 40 mg once daily or as directed by the physicians.<br>

<b>Contraindication:</b><br>
Pravastatin is contraindicated to patients with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication, active liver disease or unexplained, persistent elevation of serum transaminase.<br>

<b>Warnings & Precautions:</b><br>
Effects on skeletal muscle: Patients should be advised to promptly report to their physicians about any unexplained and/or persistent muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. Pravastatin therapy should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.<br>

<b>Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy (IMNM):</b><br>
 There have been rare reports of IMNM, an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment, positive anti-HMG-CoA reductase antibody, muscle biopsy showing necrolizing myopathy and improvement with immunosuppressive agents.<br>

<b>Liver enzyme abnormalities: </b><br>Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter.<br>

<b>Side Effects:</b><br>
In short-term clinical trials, the most commonly reported side effetcs (22% and > placebo) regardless of causality are musculoskeletal pain, nausea/vomiting, upper respiratory infection, diarrhoea and headache.<br>

<b>Use in Pregnancy & Lactation: 
</b><br>
Pravastatin is contraindicated for use in pregnant woman because of the potential for foetal harm. As safety in pregnant women has not been established and there is no apparent benefit to therapy with Pravastatin during pregnancy, Pravastatin should be immediately discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized. Administration of Pravastatin is contraindicated during breastfeeding.<br>

<b>Use in Children & Adolescents: 
</b><br>
The safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.<br>

<b>Drug interactions:</b><br>
Concomitant lipid-lowering therapies:<br>
Use with fibrates or lipid-modifying doses (21 g/day) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with Pravastatin Cyclosporine. Combination increases exposure. Limit Pravastatin to 20 mg once daily. Clarithromycin combination increases exposure. Limit Pravastatin to 40 mg once daily.<br>

<b>Overdosage:</b><br>
To date, there has been limited experience with overdosage of Pravastatin. If an overdose occurs, it should be treated symptomatically
with laboratory monitoring and supportive measures should be instituted as required.<br>

<b>Storage:</b><br>
Store below 30°C, protected from light & in a dry place. Keep all medicines out of the reach of children.<br>
