    <b>Objective:</b><br>
    <br><br>

    <b>Action:</b><br>
    <br><br>

    <b>Mode of Action:</b><br>
    Ketotifen works primarily as a mast cell stabilizer and histamine H1-receptor antagonist, meaning it prevents the release of inflammatory mediators like histamine from mast cells, and also directly blocks histamine from binding to its receptors.
    <br><br>

    <b> Development:</b><br>
    Ketotifen was first developed in Switzerland in 1970 by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals and was initially marketed for the treatment of anaphylaxis.<br>
    <br><br>
        
    <b> Interaction:</b><br>
    Toma may potentiate the effects of sedatives, hypnotics, antihistamines and alcohols. A reversible fall in the platelet count has been observed in a few patients receiving Tifen concomitantly with oral antidiabetic agents and it has been suggested that Toma should therefore be avoided.<br><br>

    <b> Contraindications:</b><br>
    A reversible fall in the platelet count has been observed in a few patients receiving Ketotifen concomitantly with oral antidiabetic agent and it has been suggested that this combination should therefore be avoided. Although there is no evidence of any teratogenic effect, recommendations for Ketotifen in pregnancy or when breast feeding can not be given.

    <b> Precautions & Warnings:</b><br>
    It is important to continue the previous treatment for a minimum of two weeks after starting Toma to avoid the possibility of exacerbation of asthma. This applies specially to systemic corticosteroids and ACTH because of the possible existence of adrenocortical insufficiency in steroid dependent patient.

During the first day of treatment with Toma, reactions may be impaired and patients should be warned not to take charge of vehicle or machinery until the effect of Toma treatment on the individual is known.
