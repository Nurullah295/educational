 <b>Need the right & effective treatment for Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea </b><br>
 <b>Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea</b><br>
Clostridium difficile is a type of bacteria that can cause diarrhoea. It often affects people who have been taking antibiotics.<br>


The estimated prevalence of the Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea (CDAD) in several South Asian countries is 10.5%.<br><br>

<b>Signs & Symptoms:</b><br>
Some people carry Clostridium difficile bacteria in their intestines but never become sick. These individuals are carriers of the bacteria and may spread infections.<br>

Mild to moderate infection:<br>
&#x2022; Watery diarrhoea three or more times a day for more than one day.<br>
&#x2022; Mild abdominal cramping and tenderness.<br>

Severe infection:<br>
Watery diarrhoea as often as 10 to 15 times a day, Abdominal cramping and pain, which may be severe, Rapid heart rate, Dehydration, Fever, Nausea, Increased white blood cell count, Kidney failure, Loss of appetite, Weight loss, Blood or pus in the stool.<br><br>

Treatment:<br>
<b>According to Davidson’s Principles and Practice of Medicine,</b><br>
“First-line antimicrobial therapy involves Metronidazole or Vancomycin. Although vancomycin is more effective than metronidazole against hypervirulent Clostridium difficile strains.”

<b>Shows excellent success rate:</b><br>
Treatment: Trial 1 (n=134) & Trial 2 (n= 125)
Treatment duration: 10 days<br>

Trial -1: 81.3%<br>
Trial -2: 80.8%<br>

Success rate in BI group:<br>
BI Strain: 87%<br>
Non BI Strain: 81%<br>
Unknown Strain: 76%<br><br>

<b>Superior to Metronidazole in severe *CDAD:</b><br>
Treatment : Metronidazole (n=289) & Vancomycin (n=266)<br>
Treatment duration: 10 days<br>

<b>Clinical Success Rate:</b><br>
Vancomycin: 78.50%<br>
Metronidazole: 66.30%<br>
Better contributes to patients’ quality of life.<br><br>


<b>Offers shorter time to resolution:</b><br>
Vancomycin: 3 Days.<br>
Metronidazole: 4.6 Days<br>
Ensures quicker relief than Metronidazole<br><br>

<b>Limited chance of resistance:</b><br>
Vancomycin is not absorbed systemically, allowing exceedingly high faecal concentrations. So that Clostridium difficile resistance to Vancomycin is limited.<br>

<b>Model Detail Talk:</b><br>
Opening:<br>
Always open with social talk:<br>
Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
In your daily practice, you are getting many patients with C.difficile associated
diarrhoea, enterocolitis, antibiotic associated diarrhoea etc. These infections
can seriously hamper the quality of life of the patients. To treat these
conditions, you always prefer Vancomycin & you are using injection form. But
if you get oral vancomycin which is very much convenient to take for patient,
which one will you prefer? Obviously oral form, right sir?<br>

Benefit Presentation:<br>
Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
You know, Vancomycin is a time-tested oral glycopeptide antibiotic. Physicians
prefer Vancomycin over other antibiotics due to its excellent efficacy. Besides,
for the global problem with antibiotic associated diarrhoea, specially
clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea and staphylococcal enterocolitis, the
first-line choice of antibiotic is oral Vancomycin. Navana Pharma introduces 1st
time in BD oral Vancomycin, Vanogut 250 mg capsule.
Vancomycin is such an preferred oral antibiotic for its excellent clinical success
against hypervirulent strains of clostridium difficile bacteria.
A clinical trial showed 87% success rate of oral Vancomycin against
hypervirulent strain of clostridium difficile related diarrhoea. Another study
shows that oral Vancomycin clinical success rate is 79% whereas
metronidazole clinical success rate is only 66%.
Sir/Madam, prescribe Vancomycin confidently because,
Vanogut 1st line treatment for C. difficile associated diarrhoea.<br>
• Vanogut has excellent success rate with early recovery<br>

<b>2. Is Vancomycin suitable in pregnancy?</b><br>
Yes. it is suitable as it's pregnancy category is B.<br>
<b>3. What is the benefits of oral Vancomycin in case of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea?</b><br>

Clostridium difficile to this drug.<br>
<b>6. Why will doctor prescribe Vanogut over Azithromycin as it is economic?</b><br>
Azithromycin is not indicated for C. difficile associated diarrhoea and Azithromycin will not work properly in this condition.
So, Doctor will prescribe oral Vancomycin in this condition.<br>

<b>•Prescribing Information:</b><br>
&#x261E; Composition: Vanogut Capsule: Each capsule contains Vancomycin Hydrochloride USP equivalent to Vancomycin 250 mg.<br>
Pharmacology:<br>
The bactericidal action of Vancomycin against Staphylococcus aureus and the vegetative cells of Clostridium difficile results primarily from inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis. In addition, Vancomycin alters bacterial cell membrane permeability and RNA synthesis. There is no cross-resistance between Vancomycin & other antibiotic.<br>
&#x261E; Indications:<br>
Vancomycin is indicated for the treatment of C. difficile associated diarrhoea & enterocolitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains).<br>
&#x261E; Dosage and Administration:<br>
C. difficile associated diarrhoea:<br>
The recommended dosage is 125 mg administered 4 times daily for 10 days.<br>
Staphylococcal enterocolitis: Total daily dose is 500 mg to 2 g administered in 3 or 4 divided doses for 7 to 10 days. For Paediatric Patients, the daily dosage is 40 mg/kg in 3 or 4 divided doses for 7 to 10 days. The total daily dose should not exceed 2 g or as directed by the physician.<br>
&#x261E; Contraindications:<br>
Vancomycin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Vancomycin.<br>
&#x261E; Warnings & Precautions:<br>
Significant serum concentrations have been reported in some patients undergoing studies & who have taken multiple doses of Vancomycin for active C. difficile associated diarrhoea. Monitoring of serum concentrations may be needed in some instances. Nephrotoxicity may occur following oral Vancomycin therapy and can occur either during or after completion of therapy. The risk is increased in geriatric patients. Ototoxicity may occur in patients receiving Vancomycin. Assessment of auditory function may be needed in some instances. Vancomycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria.<br>
&#x261E; Side Effects:<br>
The most common adverse reactions are nausea (17%), abdominal pain (15%), and hypokalemia (13%).<br>
&#x261E; Use in Pregnancy and Lactation:<br>
Pregnancy Category B. No effects on fetal weight or development were seen in rats at the highest dose. Systemic absorption of Vancomycin is very low following oral administration of Vancomycin. It is not known whether Vancomycin is excreted in human milk, as no studies of Vancomycin concentration in human milk after oral administration have been done.<br>
&#x261E; Use in Children & Adolescents:<br>
Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.<br>
Drug Interaction:<br>
No drug interaction studies have been conducted.<br>
&#x261E; Overdosage:<br>
Vancomycin is poorly removed by dialysis. Hemofiltration and hemoperfusion
with polysulfone resin have been reported to result in increased Vancomycin clearance.<br>
&#x261E; Storage:<br>
Store below 30°C, away from light and in a dry place. Keep all medicines out of the reach of children.<br>
&#x261E; Packing:<br>
Vanogut Capsule:<br>
Each box contains 2x10 capsules in Alu-Alu blister pack and an insert.<br>
