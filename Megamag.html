<b>Detailing:</b><br>
<b>Gynaecologist:</b><br>
Dear Madam,<br>
Good morning/evening, every day you get a lot of pregnant women who are suffering from pre-eclampsia due to the Lack of Magnesium. Am I right Sir? You know that around 60% of women are suffering from Magnesium deficiency.<br>
Dear Madam, Navana Pharma introduces Megamag, a preparation of Magnesium oxide which meet the unmet need of Magnesium.<br>
Madam, MegaMag ensures healthy pregnancy because Megamag<br>
• reduces preeclampsia by up to 47%<br>
• GDM by up to 42%<br>
• Low birth weight by up to 59%<br>
On the other hand, Magnesium plays a very important role in Calcium absorption. Magnesium converts vitamin D into its active form so that it can help calcium absorption. MegaMag also<br>
• reduces leg cramp frequency and intensity by up to 50%<br>
• reduces migraines by up to 41%<br>
So, considering the above benefits, may I expect 2 prescriptions daily in favor of MegaMag?<br><br>

<b>Orthopaedics and Others:</b><br>
Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
Good morning/evening, every day you get a lot of patients who are suffering from a lack of Calcium. You may prescribe them a calcium tablet.<br>
Sir/Madam,<br>
you know that for calcium absorption, the body needs vitamin D. Vitamin D is normally activated in the presence of sunlight. But it can be seen that many patients in our country stay away from sunlight. As a result, a sufficient amount of vitamin cannot be activated. Magnesium converts vitamin D into its active form so that it can help
calcium absorption.<br>
Dear Sir, for better calcium absorption Navana Pharma introduces Megamag, a preparation of Magnesium oxide.<br>
MegaMag<br>
• reduces leg cramp frequency and intensity by up to 50%<br>
• reduces migraines by up to 41%.<br>
So, considering the above benefits, may I expect 2 prescriptions daily in favor of MegaMag?<br><br>

<b>4. Why Magnesium is important in Calcium absorption?</b><br>
Ans: For calcium absorption, the body needs vitamin D. Vitamin D is normally activated in the presence of sunlight. But it can be seen that many patients in our country stay away from sunlight. As a result, a sufficient amount of vitamin cannot be activated. Magnesium converts vitamin D into its active form so that it can help calcium absorption.<br>
Role of Magnesium in Calcium absorption:<br>
Mg<b>&#8680;</b>Vitamin D<b>&#8680;</b>Activates Vitamin D<b>&#8680;</b> Increases Calcium Absorption.<br>
Magnesium converts vitamin D into its active form and increases the absorption of Calcium<br>

<b>5. Why MegaMag is important for reducing leg cramps and migraine pain?</b><br>
Ans: MegaMag reduces leg cramps by up to 50% and reduces migraine pain by up to 41.6%. That's why MegaMag is the most important supplement in leg cramps and migraine pain.<br>

<b>6. Why MegaMag is important for reducing pregnancy complications?</b><br>
Ans: MegaMag reduces pre-eclampsia by up to 47%, <br>
GDM (Gestational Diabetes Mellitus) up to 42 %, and <br>
Low birth weight by up to 59%.<br>
That's why MegaMag is the most important supplement in pregnancy.<br>

<b>7. Write down the daily recommended dose of Magnesium according to the National Institutes of Health.</b><br>
Ans: According to the National Institutes of Health, the daily recommended dose of Magnesium is given below:<br>
For Adult patients: 320 mg, In pregnancy: 360 mg & during lactation 320 mg.<br><br>

<b>Presentation Information:</b><br>
<b>Composition:</b><br>
Megamag TM
 Tablet: Each tablet contains 605.33 mg Magnesium Oxide BP equivalent to 365 mg Magnesium.<br>

<b>Pharmacology:</b><br>
Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular divalent cation and is a cofactor for more than 300 metabolic reactions in the body. These processes include protein synthesis, cellular energy production and storage, cell growth and reproduction, DNA and RNA synthesis, and stabilization of mitochondrial membranes. Magnesium is one of the minerals responsible for managing bone metabolism, nerve transmission, cardiac excitability, neuromuscular conduction, muscular contraction, vasomotor tone, and blood pressure. Magnesium also plays a significant role in glucose and insulin metabolism, mainly throug its impact on tyrosine kinase activity, phosphorylase b kinase activity, and glucose
transporter protein activity. Because of these vital roles, magnesium levels may be affected
by stressors to the body, such as in certain disease states. Supplementation with magnesium
may have therapeutic effects in these situations.<br>

<b>Pharmacokinetics:</b><br>
Absorption of a micronutrient as Mg is affected by other nutrients and reaches an estimated
30–50% of dietary Mg intake at basal conditions, while the absorption fraction declines with
age and raising Mg intake. The drug absorption depends on both the kind of Mg salt and
other food elements that may either augment or abate it.<br>
Distribution of Mg is mainly intracellular, <1% circulates in the blood (both extracellularly
and intracellularly), and total serum Mg comprises three states with roughly 60% ionized,
33% protein bound and 7% anion complexed.<br>
Elimination of Mg is handled by renal filtration with 25% being reabsorbed in the proximal
convoluted tubule and further 50–60% being reabsorbed in the loop of Henle. Around
70–80% of plasma Mg undergoes glomerular filtration, but merely 3% is eventually excreted
in the urine.<br>

<b>Indication:</b><br>
Megamag TM is indicated for the treatment of following condition:<br>
● Relieving the symptoms of magnesium deficiency<br>
● Cardiovascular system: Rapid heartbeat, heart rate irregularity, heart attack, angina
pectoris (chest pain caused by narrowing / obstruction of heart-feeding vessels), mild severe
hypertension.<br>
● Nervous system and muscles: Sudden and excessive contractions (tetania) in the muscles,
muscle cramp, gastrointestinal cramps, increased stimulability of muscles and nerves, calf
cramps, cramp conditions in newborn and young children and stress.<br>
● Gynecological diseases, birth and pregnancy: Pre-term contraction, cervical insuficiency,
premature membrane rupture, contractions during pregnancy (eclampsia [Disease with
seizures, blood pressure increase, protein in the urine, water retention in body during
pregnancy]/preeclampsia [Disease with blood pressure increase, protein in the urine, water
retention in body during pregnancy]), tocolysis requiring the use of beta mimetic
(interruption of the uterine contractions), dysmenorrhea.<br>
● Orthopedics: Calcification and ossification.<br>
