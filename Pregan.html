It binds with high affinity to the alpha 2-delta site (an auxilliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Oral bioavailability of Pregabalin is 90%. Pregabalin is eliminated largely by renal excretion, and has an elimination half-life of about 6 hours. Pregabalin can be taken with or without food.

         <b>In a Short:</b><br>
Pregabalin is an analog of the neurotransmitter GABA. It binds potently to the alpha2-delta subunit resulting in modulation of Ca channels and reduction in the release of several neurotransmitters, including glutamate, norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P.

<b>Disease profile:</b><br>
&#x2022; Fibromyalgia:<br>
Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues.<br>
&#x2022; Diabetic Neuropathy:<br>
Diabetic neuropathy is a type of nerve damage that can occur if you have diabetes. High blood sugar (glucose) can injure nerves throughout the body. Diabetic neuropathy most often damages nerves in legs and feet.<br>
&#x2022; Post herpetic neuralgia:<br>
Postherpetic neuralgia is the most common complication of shingles. The condition affects nerve fibers and skin, causing burning pain that lasts long after the rash and blisters of shingles disappear.<br>
&#x2022; Partial Seizure or Epilepsy:<br>
Seizure is a sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbance in the brain. It can cause changes in behavior, movements or feelings, and in levels of consciousness. Epilepsy is a condition that causes multiple seizures, and the seizures can be of any type. Partial seizure is a type of seizure associated with epilepsy.<br><br>

&#x2022; Short detailing:<br>
Dear sir/Madam<br>

Good morning/evening, every day you get a lot of patients who are suffering from different neuropathic pain like diabetic nerve pain, fibromyalgia & other peripheral neuropathic pain. To treat these conditions, you choose a preferable drug which is patient convenient & reduces neuropathic pain significantly. Our Pregan, a preparation of Pregabalin which is more effective & safer than TCA in diabetic neuropathy and provides greater reduction in paint intensity & pain rate.<br>
So, considering above benefits, may I expect 2 prescriptions per week in favor of Pregan. Thank you sir/madam, for giving me your valuable time.<br><br><br>

<b>Frequently Asked Questions ( FAQ )</b><br>

<b>Q. Doctor : I have started prescribing Mirogabalin which works great in treating neuropathic pain . Incidence of adverse effect is also very low . Then , why will I prescribe Pregan ER instead of Mirogabalin ?</b><br>

Ans : Thank you Sir for your interesting question . So far there is no clinical trial that claims superiority of Mirogabalin over Pregabalin extended- release formulation . Moreover,  you know that dose of Pregan ER is once daily, whereas dose of Mirogabalin is twice daily. Finally, because of being extended- release formulation, Pregan ER produces very less adverse effect compared to conventional Pregabalin. So, considering higher patient compliance you may prescribe Pregan ER. Thank you Sir .<br><br>

<b>Q. Why will doctors prefer Pregan ER (Pregabalin extended- release) to Pregabalin immediate- release ?</b><br>

Ans : Doctors will prefer Pregan ER to Pregabalin immediate- release because of the following three benefits :<br>
1. Once daily dose ensures better patient's compliance & no chance of dose missing.<br>

2. Very less adverse effect.<br>

3. More cost - effectiveness.<br>

<b>Q. When will the patient take Pregan ER ? Before or after meal ?
</b><br>
	
Ans : After meal. Specially after evening meal. Because, taking Pregan ER after evening meal will let the peak plasma concentration be achieved during sleep. In consequence, the patient will feel less adverse effect.<br>

<b>Q. What are the equivalent doses of Pregan ER to Pregan ( IR )?
</b><br>
Ans :<br>
Pregan (in 2 or 3 divided doses):<br>
150 mg / day<br>
75 mg / day<br>

 Pregan ER (Once daily ):<br>
165 mg/ day<br>
82.5 mg / day<br><br>


<b>Prescribing information:</b><br>
<b>Composition: Pregan ER 82.5:</b><br>
Each extended release tablet contains Pregabalin BP 82.5 mg. <br>
<b>Pregan ER 165:</b><br>
Each extended release tablet contains Pregabalin BP 165 mg.<br>
<b>Pregan 50: </b><br>
Each capsule contains Pregabalin BP 50 mg.<br>
<b>Pregan 75:</b><br>
Each capsule contains Pregabalin BP 75 mg. <br>
<b>Pharmacology:</b> <br>
Pregabalin is a structural derivative of gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA). It does not bind directly to GABA-A, GABA-B, or benzodiazepine receptors. It binds with high affinity to the alpha 2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Oral bioavailability of Pregabalin is 90%. Pregabalin is eliminated largely by renal excretion and has an elimination half-life of about 6 hours. Pregabalin extended release should be taken once dailly after an evening meal because of the lower bioavailability when taken on an empty
stomach and Pregabalin IR can be taken with or without food. <br>
<b>Indication: Pregabalin Capsule-</b><br>
*Neuralgia: (a) pain from diabetic neuropathy, (b) postherpetic neuralgia *Fibromyalgia *Partial seizure / epilepsy: Pregabalin is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for adult patients with partial onset seizures. *Generalized anxiety disorder. <br>
<b>Pregabalin ER- </b><br>
*Diabetic neuropathy *Postherpetic neuralgia. <br>
<b>Dosage & Administration: Pregabalin Capsule: Neuropathic pain: Adult 18 years: </b><br>
Initially 150 mg daily in 2-3 divided doses, dose can be increased if necessary after 3-7 days to 300 mg daily in 2-3 divided doses and it can be increased further if necessary after 7 days to max. 600 mg daily in 2-3 divided doses.<br>
<b>Epilepsy: Adult over 18 years:</b><br>
Initially 25 mg twice daily, dose can be increased at 7 day intervals in steps of 50 mg daily to 300 mg daily in 2-3 divided doses and it can be increased further if necessary after 7 days to max. 600 mg daily in 2-3 divided doses.<br>
<b>Generalized anxiety disorder:</b><br>
Adult over 18 years: Initially 150 mg daily in 2-3 divided doses, dose can be increased if necessary at 7 day intervals in steps of 150 mg daily; max. 600 mg dailly in 2-3 divided doses.<br>
<b> Fibromyalgia:</b><br>
The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300-450 mg/day. Initial dose 75 mg twice daily and may be increased to 150 mg twice daily within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. If the patient does not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/ day then the dose may be further increased
to 225 mg twice daily.<br>
<b>Pregabalin ER- Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy:</b><br>
Starting dose is 165 mg once daily and can be increased to 330 mg onco daily within 1 week if
necessary. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin ER is 330 mg once daily.<br>
<b>Postherpetic Neuralgia:</b> <br>
Starting dose is 165 mg once daily and can be increased to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin ER, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin ER is 660
mg once daily <b>or as directed by the physician</b>.<br> <br>

<b>Contraindication:</b><br>
Pregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin.<br>
<b>Warning & Precaution:</b><br>
Abrupt or rapid discontinuation of Pregabalin may produce some symptoms including insomnia, nausea, headache and diarrhoea, So Pregabalin should be tapered gradually over a minimum
of 1 week rather than be discontinued abruptly. Pregabalin treatment may associate with creatine kinase elevations. It should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspect or
if markedly elevated creatine kinase levels occur. <br>
<b>Side Effects:</b><br>
Pregabalin is well tolerated but few side effects like dizziness, somnolence and blurred vision may occur.<br>
<b>Use in Pregnancy & Lactation:</b><br>
<b>Pregnancy:</b> Pregabalin is a pregnancy category-C drug. It should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
<b>Lactation:</b> Pregabalin may be secreted through the breast milk like other drugs, so it should be used in nursing women only if the benefits clearly overweigh the risks.<br>
<b>Use In Children & Adolescents:</b><br>
The safety and efficacy of Pregabalin in pediatric patients have not been established.<br>
<b>Drug Interaction:</b><br>
In vitro and in vivo studies, it has been showed that Pregabalin is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions. Specifically, there are no pharmacokinetic interactions between Pregabalin and the following antiepileptic drugs: carbamazepine, valproic acid, lamotrigine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and topiramate. Important pharmacokinetic interactions are also not expected to occur between Pregabalin and commonly used antiepileptic drugs. Overdose: Overdosage of up to 8,000 mg has been reported. The symptoms consist of dizziness, somnolence, blurred vision and mild diarrhoea. Pregabalin can be removed by emesis or gastric lavage.<br>
