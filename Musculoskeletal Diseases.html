<b>1. Ankylosing Spondylitis:</b><br>
<u>Is a type of arthritis that primarily affects the spinal joints along with other joints</u> which
leads to severe chronic pain, inflammation and discomfort.<br><br>

<b>2. Bisphosphonate:</b><br>
Bisphosphonates are a group of drugs that inhibit osteoclasts which are responsible for breaking
down and reabsorbing minerals such as calcium from bone.<br><br>

<b>3 BMD (Bone Mineral Density):</b><br>
Bone density or bone mineral density, is the amount of bone mineral in bone tissue.<br><br>

<b>4 Joint Stiffness:</b><br>
Joint stiffness is the feeling that the motion of a joint is limited or difficult and loses flexibility over time.
Joint stiffness can be caused by inflammation in the synovium, the lining of the joint.<br><br>

<b>5. Osteoarthritis:</b><br>
(Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that causes the breakdown of cartilage and bone in the joints.)<br>
It most commonly affects joints in knees, hips, arms and spine, in which the joints cartilage wears
down over time, resulting in joint pain, stiffness, swelling and loss of flexibility.<br><br>

<b>6. Osteomalacia:</b><br>
Is a disease that weakens bones and can cause them to break more easily.(It's also known as adult rickets.)<br><br>

<b>7. Osteoporosis:</b><br>
It means "porous bone." It is a bone disease that occurs when the body loses too much bone, makes
too little bone or both.<br><br>

<b>8. Postmenopausal Osteoporosis:</b><br>
Postmenopausal osteoporosis generally develops after menopause, when estrogen levels drop.<br><br>

<b>9. Rheumatoid Arthritis:</b><br>
It is a chronic inflammatory disorder, where the body's autoimmune system attacks the joints
leading to tender, swollen joints and joint stiffness.<br><br>

<b>10. Rickets:</b><br>
It is the softening and weakening of bones in children.<br><br>

<b>11. Spasticity:</b><br>
(Spasticity is a condition that causes muscles to feel stiff or tight, and can make it difficult to move, walk, or speak.)<br>
Spasticity is a condition in which muscles stiffen or tighten, preventing normal fluid movement. The
muscles remain contracted and resist being stretched, thus affecting movement, speech and gait.
