<b>Q. How Lornoxicam is more efficacious than other NSAIDS?</b><br>

Ans:<br>
Lornoxicam has an inhibitory effect on COX1 and COX2 peripheral receptors as well as increases endogenous dinorphin and beta-endorphin levels promoting central analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. That's why Lornoxicam is more efficacious than other NSAIDs.<br><br>

<b>Q. How does Loxodol reduce post-operative dental pain?</b><br>
Ans:<br>
Loxodol 8 mg reduces 50% pain relief over 6 hours after a single dose.<br><br>

<b>Prescribing Information:</b><br> 
<b>Composition:</b><br>
 Loxodol 4: Each film coated tablet contains Lomoxicam INN 4 mg.<br>
 <b>Pharmacology: </b><br>
 Loroxicam belongs to oxicam
group and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), with analgesic, anti-pyretic, anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory activities.
Upon oral administration, lornoxicam binds to and inhibits the activity of the cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX) type 1 (COX-1) and type
2 (COX-2) by the ratio of 1:1 It readily penetrates into the synovial fluid. This leads to reduced prostaglandin and thromboxane
production and decreased pain, fever and inflammation. Lomoxicam is well absorbed orally and has half-life of around 3-4 hours. The
onset of action can be observed within 30 to 60 minutes of administration and eliminated via liver and kidneys (42%).<br>
Indications:<br>
Indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate pain in osteoarthritis, surgery, sciatica and other inflammations <br>
<b>Dosage & Administration: </b>c
Pain relief: Adult: 8-16 mg daily. Max: 24 mg daily. Osteoarthritis & Rheumatoid arthritis: Adult 12 mg daily in 2-3
divided doses, up to 16 mg daily if needed. It should be taken before meal to minimize gastrointestinal irritation or as directed by the
physician. <br>
<b>Contraindication: </b><br>
Contraindicated in patients with peptic ulcer, severe kidney impairment and hypersensitivity.
Lornoxicam can increase risk of fatal heart attack or stroke. <br>
<b>Warnings & Precautions: </b><br>
It is not recommended to administer Lornoxicam to patients with history of peptic ulcer, hypersensitivity, impaired kidney or liver function, high blood pressure, heart failure,
ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, asthma and lupus erythematosus, diabetes or blood coagulation disorder. <br>
<b>Side Effects: </b><br>
The most common side effects are: Gastrointestinal Abdominal pain, diarrhea, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, inflammation of pancreas
and mouth ulcer. Central Nervous System: Headache, drowsiness, sleeplessness and dizziness, Eye and ENT: Visual disturbance,
ringing in ear and sensitivity to light. Heart High blood pressure, palpitations and fluid retention. Skin: Skin rash. <br>
<b>Use in Pregnancy & Lactation: </b><br>
Lornoxicam is not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding and is contraindicated during the last third of
pregnancy. <br>
<b>Use in Children & Adolescents: </b><br>
Due to lack of data, Lornoxicam is not indicated for children and adolescents below 18
years old. <br>
<b>Drug Interactions: </b><br>
Combination with Vitamin K antagonists like warfarin increases the risk of bleeding. Combination with
Cyclosporin can lead to reduced kidney function, and to acute kidney injury in rare cases. Lornoxicam can also increase the adverse
effects of lithium, methotrexate and digoxin and its derivatives. The effect of diuretics, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor
antagonists can be reduced, in patients with heart failure. <br>
<b>Overdosage: </b><br>
Symptoms: Increased side effects from the central nervous
system and gastrointestinal tract, increased blood pressure, cardiac and/ or acute renal failure Treatment: Gastric lavage,
appointment of activated carbon & monitoring of vital functions. <br>
<b>Storage: </b><br>
Store below 30°C, away from light and in a dry place. Keep
out of the reach of children. Packing: Loxodol 4: Each box contains 3 X 10 tablets in Alu-PVC blister pack & an insert
