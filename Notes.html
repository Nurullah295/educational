<b>Glucagon</b><br>
Glucagon is a peptide hormone, produced by alpha cells of the pancreas. It raises the concentration of glucose
 and fatty acids in the bloodstream and is considered to be the main catabolic hormone of the body. It is 
 also used as a medication to treat a number of health conditions. Its effect is opposite to that of insulin, 
 which lowers extracellular glucose. It is produced from proglucagon, encoded by the GCG gene.
The pancreas releases glucagon when the amount of glucose in the bloodstream is too low. Glucagon causes 
the liver to engage in glycogenolysis: converting stored glycogen into glucose, which is released into the 
bloodstream. High blood-glucose levels, on the other hand, stimulate the release of insulin. Insulin 
allows glucose to be taken up and used by insulin-dependent tissues. Thus, glucagon and insulin are part 
of a feedback system that keeps blood glucose levels stable. Glucagon increases energy expenditure and is 
elevated under conditions of stress. Glucagon belongs to the secretin family of hormones.<br><br>

<b>Function</b><br>

Glucagon generally elevates the concentration of glucose in the blood by promoting gluconeogenesis and 
glycogenolysis. Glucagon also decreases fatty acid synthesis in adipose tissue and the liver, as well 
as promoting lipolysis in these tissues, which causes them to release fatty acids into circulation where 
they can be catabolised to generate energy in tissues such as skeletal muscle when required.<br>

Glucose is stored in the liver in the form of the polysaccharide glycogen, which is a glucan (a polymer 
made up of glucose molecules). Liver cells (hepatocytes) have glucagon receptors. When glucagon binds to 
the glucagon receptors, the liver cells convert the glycogen into individual glucose molecules and release 
them into the bloodstream, in a process known as glycogenolysis. As these stores become depleted, glucagon 
then encourages the liver and kidney to synthesize additional glucose by gluconeogenesis. Glucagon turns 
off glycolysis in the liver, causing glycolytic intermediates to be shuttled to gluconeogenesis.

Glucagon also regulates the rate of glucose production through lipolysis. Glucagon induces lipolysis 
in humans under conditions of insulin suppression (such as diabetes mellitus type 1).

Glucagon production appears to be dependent on the central nervous system through pathways yet to be defined. 
In invertebrate animals, eyestalk removal has been reported to affect glucagon production. Excising the 
eyestalk in young crayfish produces glucagon-induced hyperglycemia.<br><br>


<b>Metabolism</b><br> is the set of life-sustaining chemical reactions in organisms.
The three main functions of metabolism are:
the conversion of the energy in food to energy available to run cellular processes;
the conversion of food to building blocks of proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and some carbohydrates; and

the elimination of metabolic wastes. These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, 
maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. The word metabolism can also refer to the sum 
of all chemical reactions that occur in living organisms, including digestion and the transportation of 
substances into and between different cells, in which case the above described set of reactions within 
the cells is called intermediary (or intermediate) metabolism.
<br><br>
<b>Anabolism</b><br> is the set of metabolic pathways that construct macromolecules like DNA or RNA from 
smaller units. These reactions require energy, known also as an endergonic process. Anabolism is 
the building-up aspect of metabolism, whereas catabolism is the breaking-down aspect. Anabolism is usually 
synonymous with biosynthesis.
<br><br>
<b>Catabolism</b><br> is the set of metabolic pathways that breaks down molecules into smaller units that 
are either oxidized to release energy or used in other anabolic reactions. Catabolism breaks down large 
molecules (such as polysaccharides, lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins) into smaller units 
(such as monosaccharides, fatty acids, nucleotides, and amino acids, respectively). 
Catabolism is the breaking-down aspect of metabolism, whereas anabolism is the building-up aspect.
