<b>Product Orientation & Presentation:</b><br>  
<b>Need Assesment:</b><br>
Knock Out, all the complications of Neuropathic Pain Management.<br>
Despite having treatment-induced side effects like vertigo, nausea, dizziness etc., immediate-release
Pregabalin has been used to manage neuropathic pain for a long time since there was no better
alternative. However, a miraculous drug has emerged with the promise to wipe out all the complications
associated with immediate-release Pregabalin. Furthermore, the drug is 17 times more potent than
immediate-release Pregabalin & 40 times more potent than Gabapentin.

<b>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):</b><br>
<b class="FQ">Q1. Is Mirogabalin superior to Pregan ER?/Is Mirogabalin superior to Pregan ER?</b><br>
Ans: In fact, there is no head to head study between Mirogabalin & Pregan ER. All the superiority of
Mirogabalin compared with Pregabalin IR not with ER. But in indirect comparison, we can say Mirogabalin
is slightly better than Pregan ER (but significantly better than Pregabalin IR) in the term of efficacy to
control neuropathic pain but side effects are almost same. However, Pregan ER has some extra ordinary
benefit including:<br>
i. Once daily dosing<br>
ii. Economical therapy<br>
iii. Having FDA approval<br>
The fact is that, Pregan ER is more profitable than Neumir, but Market is continuously being shifted to
Mirogabalin from Pregabalin IR. So, we will promote both the Brand vigorously with the conclusion that,<br>
Neumir is the most effective therapy.<br>
Pregan ER is the cost effective therapy.<br>
Positioning Statement:<br>
Neumir will be promoted to all the targeted doctors as the most effective &
advanced oral treatment option for the management of neuropathic pain.<br>

*We will not promote Neumir to the prescriber of Pregan ER & most frequent prescribers of ER
formulation of Pregabalin. Pregan ER will be vigorously promoted to them.<br><br>

<b class="FQ">Q2. What is Neuropathic Pain?</b><br>
Ans: Neuropathic pain is the nerve pain from damage of malfunction of nervous system. Damaged nerve
fibers send the wrong signals pain centers resulting in neuropathic pain. About 30% of neuropathy cases
occur due to diabetes, but hundreds of other diseases- like shingles, HIV/AIDS and alcohol use
disorder can cause neuropathic pain too. The symptoms of neuropathic pain including burning, stabbing
or electric shock-like pain, tingling, numbness or a pins and needles feeling.<br><br>

<b class="FQ">Q3. What is Peripheral Neuropathy?</b><br>
Ans: Nerve pain due to damage in peripheral nerves is known as peripheral neuropathy. The part or
nerves of Nervous system that present outside our brain and spinal cord is known as peripheral nerves.
Peripheral neuropathy causes weakness, numbness and pain, usually in the hands and feet.<br><br>

<b class="FQ">Q4. What is Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)?</b><br>
Ans: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a condition caused by long-term high blood sugar levels, which
causes nerve damage.<br><br>

<b class="FQ">Q5. What is Post-Herpetic neuralgia (PHN)?</b><br>
Ans: Post-herpetic neuralgia is a lasting nerve pain in the areas of skin after having shingle (a type of
chicken pox). It affects nerve fibers and skin, causing burning pain that lasts long.<br><br>

<b class="FQ">Q6. What is Low Back Pain (LBP)?</b><br>
Ans: Low back pain (LBP) describes pain between the lower edge of the ribs and the buttock. It can last
for a short time (acute), a little longer (sub-acute) or a long time (chronic)<br><br>

<b class="FQ">Q7. 'Neumir is 20 times more potent than Pregaballin. Justify the statement.</b><br>
Ans: According to some authentic published studies, efficacy of 20 mg of Mirogabalin is equivalent to
600 mg of IR Pregabalin. So, Neumir is 20 times more potent than Pregabalin.<br><br>

<b class="FQ">Q8. 'Neumir is 40 times more potent than Gabapentin. Justify the statement.</b><br>
Ans: According to some authentic studies, efficacy of 30 mg of Mirogabalin is equivalent to 1200 mg of
IR Pregabalin. So, Neumir is 40 times more potent than Gabapentin.<br><br>

<b class="FQ">Q9. How is Neumir more effective than IR Pregabalin?</b><br>
Ans: Blocking &#x3B1;2&#x3B4;-1 (alpha two delta one) subunit of Calcium Channel Blocker is considered responsible
for blocking sensation of neuropathic pain. The binding affinity of Mirgobalin for the &#x3B1;2&#x3B4;-1 subunit greater
than conventional (IR) Pregabalin. So, Neumir is more effective than conventional pregabalin to treat
neuropathic pain.<br><br>

<b class="FQ">Q10. How is Neumir safer than IR Pregabalin?</b><br>
Ans: &#x3B1;2&#x3B4;-2 (alpha two delta two) subunit of Calcium Channel Blocker is considered responsible for CNS
adverse effects if it is tightly inhibited. The binding affinity of Mirgobalin for the &#x3B1;2&#x3B4;-2 subunit is much
lower than conventional (IR) Pregabalin. So, Neumir shows less adverse effects & Neumir is safer than IR
Pregabalin.<br><br>

<b class="FQ">Q11. How does Neumir work safer than IR Pregabalin?</b><br>
Ans: Onset of action of Pregabalin is almost 90 minutes while Neumir starts to reduce pain within 60
mints. So, Neumir works faster than Pregabalin.<br><br>

<b class="FQ">Q12. Suppose a doctor told you that 'I don't write Mirogablin because it's not FDA Approved?'. How
will you pursue him to prescribe Neumir'?</b><br>
Ans: Thank you Sir, we really appreciate your concern. You will be very happy to know that it has entered
in the last phases of FDA approval pending list & expected to be approved soon by this year. However,
Mirogabalin has been being widely used in Japan & so many European countries successfully. There are
so many authentic & promising trials that found better efficacy & safety of Neumir orver Pregabalin. As a
better & safer therapy, you can consider Neumir to manage neuropathic pain.<br><br>

<b>Abridged Prescribing Information:</b><br>
<b>Composition:</b><br>

Neumir 2.5:<br>
Each tablet contains Mirogabalin INN 2.5 mg.<br>
Neumir 5:<br>
Each tablet contains Mirogabalin INN 5 mg.<br>
Neumir 10:<br>
Each tablet contains Mirogabalin INN 10 mg.<br>

<b>Pharmacology:</b><br>
Neumir is a tablet preparation of Mirogabalin that belongs to the gabapentinoid group. Mirogabalin is a specific and potent ligand of the a₂o subunit of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>²</sup>+ channels that inhibits calcium
ions influx and suppresses the release of neurotransmitters in the nervous system to reduce pain. Mirogabalin's selective binding for &#945;<sub>₂</sub>&#948;-1 and &#945;<sub>₂</sub>&#948;-2 subunits and its slower dissociation rate from the &#945;<sub>₂</sub>&#948;-1
than &#945;<sub>₂</sub>&#948;-2 subunits of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>²</sup>+ channels might contribute to its higher analgesic efficacy and safety margin with relatively lower incidence of CNS adverse effects.<br>

<b>Indications:</b><br>
Peripheral neuropathic pain including:*Diabetic, peripheral neuropathy, *Post-herpetic neuralgia *Spinal pain.<br>

<b>Dosage and Administration:</b><br>
Normally, the initial dose for adults is 5 mg of Mirogabalin given orally twice daily and then the dose may be gradually increased by 5 mg at an interval of at least a week to 15 mg, given orally twice daily.

If the patient misses a dose, he/she must take the missed dose as soon as possible. If it
is almost time for the next dose, the patient should skip the missed dose and continue his/her regular dosing schedule. Mirogabalin dosage adjustment based on renal function: No dose adjustment is recommended in mild renal impairment. Dose to be reduced to 50% in moderate renally impaired patients. A dose reduction of up to 75% required in patients with severe renal impairment and End-Stage Renal Disease.<br>
