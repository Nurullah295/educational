<b>Product Orientation & Presentation:</b><br>
<b>Need Assesment:</b><br>
Dyspepsia prevalence 62%(Highest in Bangladesh). Domperidone has been being used for the treatment of dyspepsia for a long-time. But it causes 10
to 15% cases of mammoplasia, mastodynia, galactorrhea and amenorrhea in females and low
libido, erectile dysfunction, impaired spermatogenesis, gynecomastia and increased risk of sudden
cardiac death by 70% in males.<br>
Itopride HCI, a new Prokinetic drug has been reported to improve gastrointestinal motility by a dual
mode of action. It is comparable to Domperidone in relieving symptoms, well-tolerated with no
cardiac side effects.

Dopamine D2 receptor antagonism removes the inhibitory relief on acetylcholine release. The inhibition of enzyme acetylcholinesterase prevents degradation of acetylcholine. The net effect is an increase in acetylcholine concentration, promoting gastric motility, accelerating gastric emptying and having an anti-enetic action.</p>

    <p class="FQ">4. Itopri is better than Domperidone, justify this statement.</p>
    <p>Ans: Troma clinical study H, has been found that, itopride clinically & Statically better than Domperidone in terms of moderate to complete relief from Non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) as itopride relief 81 % of dyspepsia whereas Domperidone relief only 70% dyspepsia, so itopri is a better symptom reliever compared to Domperidone.</p>

    <p class="FQ">5. What is dyspepsia? What are the symptoms of dyspepsia?</p>
    <p>Ans: Dyspepsia describes symptoms such as GI discomfort, bloating and nausea, which are thought to originate from the upper gastrointestinal tract. Dyspepsia affects up to 80% of the population at some time in life. Symptoms of Dyspepsia are early satiety, postprandial fullness, bloating, Epigastric pain, Epigastric burning, Nausea, Belching and heartburn</p>

    <p class="FQ">6. What is acetylcholine? Define the function of acetylcholine.</p>
    <p>Ans: Acetylcholine is an excitatory neurotransmitter, it's promotes gastric motility, accelerates gastric emptying and has an end-meter action.</p>

    <p class="FQ">7. What is the time of onset of action of Itopride and what is the name of the therapeutic class of Itopride?</p>
    <p>Ans: The onset of action time is 35 minutes and the name of the therapeutic class of Itopride is gastroprokinetics.</p>

<p class="FQ">Dyspepsia prevalence in Bangladesh</p>
 62%(Highest in Bangladesh)

<p class="FQ">Major Adverse effects Domperidone</p>
But it causes 10 to 15% cases of <br>
mammoplasia(the normal or spontaneous enlargement of the breasts),<br> mastodynia(breast pain),<br>
 galactorrhea(production of breast milk that is not associated with pregnancy or breastfeeding) and <br>
 amenorrhea(the absence of menstruation) in females and <br>
 low libido(desire for sexual activity),<br>
 erectile dysfunction, <br>
 impaired spermatogenesis(process of sperm cell development in the testes), <br>
 gynecomastia(an increase in the amount of breast gland tissue in boys or men) and <br>
 increased risk of sudden cardiac death by 70% in males.<br>


        <h3>Short Detailing</h3>

        <h3>Sir/Madam,</h3>

Itopri reduces dyspepsia symptoms like early satiety, postprandial fullness, bloating, epigastric pain, epigastric burning, nausea, belching including heartburn significantly.</p>

        <h3>Sir/Madam,</h3>
        <p>Itopride is a safe alternative to Domperidone. Itopri ensures fast action, fast relief, least chance of drug-drug interactions, no impact on QT prolongation thus ensures cardiac safety, does not cross BBB thus ensure less CNS side effect, No remarkable rise in prolactin level.</p>
