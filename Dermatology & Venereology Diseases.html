Dermatology & Venereology
1.
Acne: Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It
causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples.
2. Androgenic Acne: Androgenic acne or hormonal acne refers to breakouts that occur due to hormone fluctuations,
particularly hyperactivity of androgens. Although this acne that results from androgen hormone fluctuations in
puberty, it may affect adults at any age.
3.
Antifungal resistance: Antifungal resistance occurs when fungi no longer respond to antifungal drugs.
4. Atopic Dermatitis: Atopic Dermatitis is the most common form of eczema characterized by itchy, dry and cracked skin.
Atopic eczema is more common in children, often developing before their first birthday. But it may also develop in adults.
Dermatophytes: Dermatophytes are fungi. These fungi can cause superficial infections of the skin, hair and nails.
5.
6. Keratinization: Keratinization is defined as cytoplasmic events that take place in keratinocytes that move through the
different layers of the epidermis to finally differentiate into corneocytes.
7. Onychomycosis: Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail. It is the most common disease of the nails and
constitutes about half of all nail abnormalities. This condition may affect toenails or fingernails, but toenail infections
are particularly common.
8. Oropharyngeal candidiasis: Oral candidiasis (also known as oral candidiasis, oral thrush, oropharyngeal candidiasis,
moniliasis, candidal stomatitis, muguet) is candidiasis that occurs in the mouth. Oral candidiasis is a mycosis



(yeast/fungal infection) of candida species on the mucous membranes of the mouth.
3. pas versicolor: The fungus interferes with the normal pigmentation of the skin, resulting in small, discolored
patches. It most commonly affects the trunk and shoulders.
10. Tinea: Any fungal skin disease is called Tinea. For example: Ringworm.
11. Tinea corporis: It is also known as ringworm, a superficial fungal infection (dermatophytosis) of the arms and legs,
especially on glabrous skin.
12. Tinea cruris: Tinea cruris is a fungal infection that causes a red and itchy rash in warm and moist areas of the body.
13. Tinea pedis: Athlete's foot (Tinea pedis) is a fungal infection that usually begins between the toes
melanin, which is the pigment in skin.
14. Vitiligo: Vitiligo is a long-term condition where pale white patches develop on the skin. It's caused by the lack of
15. Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC): This is a yeast infection of the lower female reproductive tract.
16. Oral thrush: Oral thrush is a fungal infection of the mouth. It's not contagious and is usually successfully treated with
antifungal medication. It's also called oral candidosis (or candiasis) because it's caused by a group of yeasts called
Candida.

<strong>Breast Tenderness:</strong> <br>
<p>Breast pain (mastalgia) can be described as tenderness, <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">Breast pain (mastalgia) can be described as tenderness, throbbing, sharp, stabbing, burning pain or tightness in the breast tissue. The pain may be constant or it may occur only occasionally, and it can occur in men, women and transgender people. Breast pain can range from mild to severe.<br>
Breast tenderness may be associated with either hormonal or reproductive changes (such as early pregnancy, premenstrual syndrome, or premenstrual tension), dietary changes (such as large amounts of caffeine), use of estrogen medications (such as birth control pills), weight gain leading to breast ptosis (drooping), or a primary disorder in which breast tenderness is just one of several symptoms. Some of these primary disorders may include mastitis (breast inflammation), which is often experienced while breastfeeding, fibrocystic breast disease (benign breast changes), or more serious disorders such as ectopic pregnancy (life-threatening pregnancy growing outside the uterus), breast abscess, or a benign or malignant tumor.<br>
Breast tenderness that is cyclical may be related to hormonal changes and reproductive cycles. Often a simple change in diet or occasional use of over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen can be enough to alleviate the pain. On the other hand, some symptoms (such as persistent pain, tenderness lasting more than two weeks, and tenderness with no relation to your menstrual cycle) may indicate a more serious condition, such as breast abscess or breast cancer.
