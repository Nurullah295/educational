<b>Prescribing Information</b><br>

<b>Composition:</b><br>
Each extended release tablet contains Clonidine Hydrochloride USP 0.1 mg. <br>

<b>Pharmacology:</b><br>
Clonidine stimulates alpha-2
adrenergic receptors in the brain. Clonidine is not a central nervous system stimulant. The mechanism of action of clonidine in ADHD is not
known. By stimulating alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the brain stem, clonidine reduces sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system
and decreases peripheral resistance, renal vascular resistance, heart rate and blood pressure.<br>

<b>Indications:</b><br>
Clonidine Hydrochloride extended
release tablet is indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as monotherapy.<br>

<b>Dosage and Administration:</b><br>
Dosing should be initiated with one 0.1 mg tablet at bedtime and the daily dosage should be adjusted in increments of 0.1 mg/day at weekly
intervals until the desired response is achieved. Doses should be taken twice a day, with either an equal or higher split dosage being given at
bedtime, as depicted below.<br>

0.1 mg/day/Bedtime.<br>
0.1 mg Morning & 0.1 mg Bedtime.
<br>
0.1 mg Morning & 0.2 mg Bedtime.
<br>
0.2 mg Morning & 0.2 mg Bedtime.
<br>

When discontinuing, taper the dose in decrements of no more than 0.1 mg every 3 to 7 days.<br>

<b>Warnings & Precautions: </b><br>Instruct patients not to discontinue therapy without consulting their physician. Sudden cessation of Clonidine treatment has resulted in symptoms such as nervousness, agitation, headache and tremor accompanied or followed by a rapid rise in blood pressure and elevated catecholamine concentrations in the plasma. When discontinuing therapy with Clonidine ER Tablet, reduce the dose gradually over 2 to 4 days to avoid withdrawal symptoms. If therapy is to be discontinued in patients receiving a beta-blocker and Clonidine
concurrently, the beta-blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual discontinuation of Clonidine ER Tablet.<br>

<b>Side effects:</b><br>
Most side effects are mild and tend to diminish with continued therapy. The most frequent side effects (which appears to be dose related) are dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation and sedation, ear pain, irritability, constipation, diarrhoea, abdominal pain & nausea.<br>

<b>Use in Pregnancy & Lactation: </b><br>
Pregnancy Category C. So, Clonidine should be avoided during pregnancy.<br>
As Clonidine is excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Clonidine is administered to nursing mother.<br>

<b>Use in Children & Adolescents:
</b><br>
 Safety and effectiveness in
pediatric patients less than 6 years old have not been established in adequate and well-controlled trials. 
<br>
<b>Drug interaction:</b><br>
Clonidine may potentiate CNS depressive effect of alcohol, barbiturates or other sedative drugs. Hypotensive effect may be reduced if a patient receives
Clonidine and tricyclic anti-depressant; where increased dose of Clonidine is required. Due to a potential for additive effects (such as bradycardia & A.V. block) caution is warranted in patients receiving Clonidine concomitantly with agents (e.g. digitalis, calcium channel blockers & B-blockers) known to affect sinus node function or A.V. nodal conduction.<br>

<b>Overdosage:</b><br>
Overdosage may cause hypotension,
bradycardia, respiratory depression, hypothermia, sedation, abnormal reflexes, weakness & miosis.<br>
	
<b>Storage:</b><br>
Store below 30°C, away from
