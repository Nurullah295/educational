<b>Q. Mention two major complicabons of CKD.</b><br>
Ans: <br>
Hyperphosphatemia<br>
Anemia<br>

<b>Q.How does Phoscon (Ferric Citrate) correct metabolic Acidosis in renal failure
patients?</b><br>
Ans: <br>
The absorbed citrate from ferric Citrate Is converted to bicarbonate, which corrects
metabolic acidosas, a common condition in renal failure patients.<br>

<b>Q.Phoscon successfully reduces phosphate. Justify the statement.</b><br>
Ans:<br>
In a clinical study It has been found that Ferric Citrate reduces serum phosphate
level from 7.41 to 4.86 mg/dl. From the result of study we can justify that Phoscon
successfully reduces phosphate level.<br>

<b>Q.Phoscon ensures better patients satisfaction. Justify the statement.</b><br>
Ans:<br>
In a clinical study it has been found that, Ferric citrate reduced serum phosphate level 5.66 to 4.37
mg/dl and 64.9% patients achieved targeted phosphate level in ferric citrate group. It was also found that placebo treated patient reduced Phosphate level 5.57 to 5.62 mg/dl.
So, Phoscon ensures better phosphate control & patients satisfaction.<br>

<b>Q.Phoscon ensures less elemental IV iron requirement. Justify the statement.</b><br>
Ans:<br>
In a clinical study it has been found that 85% patients required no IV iron. So, Phoscon ensures less elemental IV iron requirement.<br>

<b>Q.Why Phoscon is better than Sevelamer?</b><br>
Ans:<br>
Phoscon ensures better Phosphate control compared to Sevelamer and additionally Phoscon increases serum Hemoglobin and Ferritin level in CKD patients. Sevelamer has no role on
improving serum Hemoglobin and Ferritin level.<br><br>

<b>Q.Terminology</b><br>
Kidney: The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs i the renal system. They help the
body to pass waste as urine,
N.phron: The nephron is the structural and functional unit of the kidney.
Acute Kidney Disease: Kidneys suddenly become unable to filter waste products from
blood. When kidneys lose thea’ ltenng ability, dangerous levels of wastes may
accumulate, and bloods chemical makeup may get out of balance.
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): CKD can be defined as the occurrence of kidney
damage andio reduced kidney function 8 GFR is less than 60 that lasts for three

months or more
Hyp.rphosphatemia: Having too much phosphorus in blood is called

<b>Q.hyperphospliatemia?</b><br>
Renal Anemia: When kidneys are diseased or damaged. they do not make enou
Eryttiropoeitln. As a result, the bone marrow makes fewer red bd cells, causing<br>

<b>Q.anemia?</b><br>

<b>GFR:</b><br>
Glomerular fItration rate (GFR) is a test used to check how well the kidneys are
working. Norma( GFR Is usually >90 ml/min/1.73m²/ meaning a healthy kidney function is indicated by a GFR value above 90 milliliters per minute per 1.73 square meters of body surface area)<br>

<b>Renal Ost.odystrophy:</b><br>
Renal osteodystrophy is a bone disease that occurs when kidneys fail to maintain proper levels at calcium and phosphorus In the blood.
