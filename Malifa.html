<b>Detailing</b><br>
	
Why injection?<br>
oral form may be offer almost same benefits. <br>


Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
Would you prescribe the injectable when oral form may offer almost the same benefits? <br>
For severe anaemia you are prescribing IV iron. It is the safest option but using IV iron has some hazards such as increased health care costs, the need to visit the clinic for infusion, higher infection rate, Iron overload, and sometimes hyperphosphatemia and anaphylactic shock. Am I right Sir?<br>
Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
Navana Pharma Introduces a breakthrough Oral iron therapy Malifa capsule, which offers comparable efficacy to IV iron.<br>
Dear Sir/Madam, According to the Journal of Inflammatory Bowel Disease oral Ferric Maltol may offer a patient convenient and cost-effective alternative to IV Ferric Carboxy Maltose for patients with Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IDA) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).<br>
Dear Sir, Malifa is a stable complex of Ferric Maltol that remains stable while passing through the stomach. That's why it does not produce any reactive oxygen and causes very less side effects like Ferrous Iron. So,<br>
Malifa is better than Ferrous Iron.<br>
	
<b>Oral VS IV:</b><br>
Hemoglobin improvement(≥1g/dl) after 12 weeks.<br>
Ferric Maltol(Oral)= 85%<br>
Ferric Carboxymaltose(IV)= 89%<br>
Offers comparable efficacy to IV iron.<br><br>
	
Dear Sir, in a clinical study it has been shown that Malifa increases Hb level from 11 g/dl to 13.2 g/dl and ferritin level from 8.6 µg/dl to 26 µg/dl. Malifa also ensures patients' response rates up to 78% (greater than 1 g/dl) & 56% (greater than 2 g/dl).<br>
That's why Malifa is very much effective in IDA.<br>
Dear Sir/Madam, In a clinical study it has been found around 94% of patients continued their treatment with Ferric Maltol because of the least adverse effects. Even it is safer than a placebo (91%).<br>
That's why Malifa is a safer option for Anaemia.<br>
Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
Malifa-<br>
- Unique mode of action with fewer side effects.<br>
- Patients' convenient alternative to IV Ferric carboxymaltose.<br>
- Safe and more tolerable iron treatment.<br>
Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
Navana offers Malifa capsule which offers IV iron-like efficacy. Considering all these benefits may expect 2 Rx of Malifa. Malifa is available at your nearest chemist shop.<br><br>


আসুন মুখস্থ করি!! !<br>
প্রিয় স্যার এবং ম্যাডাম, oral dosage form যদি IV injection এর মতই কাজ করে সাথে সাথে injection দেওয়ার যে ঝামেলা সেটা avoid করা

প্রিয় স্যার এবং ম্যাডাম, একটি ক্লিনিক্যাল গবেষণায় দেখা গেছে যে মালিফা Hb এর মাত্রা 11 g/dl থেকে 13.2 g/dl এবং ফেরিটিনের মাত্রা 8.6ug/dl
থেকে 26 ug/dl এ উন্নিত করে। এছাড়াও Malifa এর patient respond rate অনেক ভালো। ক্লিনিক্যাল গবেষণায় দেখা যায় যে Malifa, placebo
থেকেও বেশি নিরাপদ।<br>
প্রিয় স্যার এবং ম্যাডাম, উপরিউক্ত সুবিধা বিবেচনা করে আমি কি আপনার কাছে আপনার পরবর্তী রোগীদের জন্য Malifa capsule এর দুইটি প্রেসক্রিপশন

<b>Prescribing information:</b><br>
Composition:<br>
Malifa 30:<br>
Each capsule contains Ferric Maltol INN equivalent to iron 30 mg.<br>
Pharmacology:<br>
Ferric Maltol delivers iron for uptake across the intestinal wall and transfers to transferrin and ferritin. It has been shown to increase serum iron parameters, including ferritin and transferrin saturation. Ferric Maltol dissociates upon uptake from the Gastrointestinal Tract allowing iron and maltol to be absorbed separately. The iron is absorbed across the intestinal wall and transfer to transferrin and ferritin. It increases serum iron parameters, including ferritin and transferrin saturation. Total serum iron peak values were reached 1.5 to 3 hours after administration. Food has been shown to decrease the bioavailability of iron after administration of ferric maltol. Around 60% of ferric maltol is excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugate, Iron and ferric maltol are not excreted in the urine and unabsorbed ferric maltol is eliminated in the feces.<br>
Indications:<br>
It is indicated for the treatment of iron deficiency in adults.<br>
Dosage & Administration:<br>
30 mg twice daily on an empty stomach (Morning & Evening). Continue as long as necessary to replenish body iron stores or as directed by the physician.<br>
Contraindications:<br>
It is contraindicated in patients with a history of:<br>
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Hemochromatosis and other iron overload syndromes. Receiving repeated blood transfusions.<br>
Warnings & Precautions:<br>
Avoid use of Ferric Maltol in patients with an active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) flare as there is potential risk of increased inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Excessive therapy with iron drugs can lead to excess storage of iron with the possibility of iatrogenic hemosiderosis. Accidental overdose of iron-containing drugs is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6 years.<br>

Side Effects:<br>
The most common side effects include gas, diarrhoea, constipation, discolored stools, stomach pain, nausea or vomiting and stomach area discomfort or bloating.<br>
Use in Pregnancy & Lactation:<br>
In a clinical study, it has been found that oral use of Ferric Iron in pregnant women indicate no malformative nor fetotoxicity: Ferric Maltol may be considered during pregnancy if necessary. There is no effects of oral Ferric Iron in breastfeed newborns or infants of treated mother. Ferric Maltol can be used during breastfeeding if clinically needed.<br>

Use in Children & Adolescents:<br>
Safety and effectiveness of Ferric Maltol have not been established in paediatric patients.<br>
Drug Interactions:<br>
Dimercaprol: Concomitant use of iron products with dimercaprol may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. The absorption of certain oral medications decreases such as bisphosphonates, levodopa, thyroid medications and tetracycline antibiotics when given together with iron.<br>
Overdosage:<br>
Early signs and symptoms of iron overdosage may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. In more serious cases, hypoperfusion, metabolic acidosis and systemic toxicity are observed. Dosages of excess iron may lead to hemosiderosis.<br>
Storage:<br>
Store below 30°C, away from light and in a dry place. Keep all medicines out of reach of children.<br> Packing:<br>
Malifa 30:<br>Each box contains 3 X 10 capsules in Alu-Alu blister pack and an insert.<br>
