    </div>
<strong>Q. What is Pharmacology?:</strong><br>
The science that deals with the origin, nature, chemistry, effects and uses of drugs. It includes
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacotherapeutics and toxicology.<br><br>

<strong>Q. What is Drug?:</strong><br>
A drug is an active ingredient which is used in the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of a disease<br>
e.g. Aspirin and Paracetamol is used to treat pain and fever.<br><br>

<strong>Q. What is Prodrug?:</strong><br>
Prodrugs are the drugs which do not produce any pharmacological effect until they are chemically
altered within the body.<br>
e.g

<strong>Q. What is Medicine?:</strong><br>
It is the drug or combination of drugs which is supplied in a proper form, in a proper container with
a label and in particular dosage form.<br> 
e.g. Paracetamol 500 mg tablet.<br><br>

<strong>Q. What do you mean by OTC (Over The Counter)?:</strong><br>
Drugs that an individual can purchase without a prescription from their doctor. <br>
e.g. Paracetamol,<br>
Omeprazole etc.<br><br>

<strong>Q. What do you mean by Pharmacodynamics?:</strong><br>
Pharmacodynamics is what drug does to the body. It deals with site of action of drugs & effects of
drugs<br><br>

<strong>Q. What do you mean by Pharmacokinetics?</strong><br>
Pharmacokinetic is what body does to the drugs. <br>
<b>It deals with</b><strong>ADME:</strong><br>
(Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion) of drugs<br><br>
 
<strong>Absorption:</strong><br>
The uptake of drug into the blood stream.<br><br>

<strong>Distribution:</strong><br>
Absorbed drug from the blood stream to the site of action.<br><br>

<strong>Metabolism:</strong><br>The breakdown of drug by liver.<br><br>

<strong>Excretion:</strong><br>The elimination of a medication from the body primarily through the kidney.<br><br>

<strong>Q. What is agonist and antagonist?</strong><br>

<strong>Agonist:</strong><br>
a drug that binds to a receptor and activates the receptor to produce a biological
response, <br>
e.g. Clonazepam (Conpan) binds to GABA receptor and increases the GABA activity<br>
<strong>Antagonist:</strong><br>
A drug that counteracts the effects of another drug (blocks, inhibits or interferes with
the effects of an agonist). e.g. <br>
Montelukast (Arokast) blocks the effects of Leukotriene
(Leukotriene receptor blocker).<br><br>

<strong>Receptor:</strong><br>
A molecule on the surface or within a cell that recognizes and binds with specific
molecules, producing a specific effect in the cell. <br>
e.g. GABA receptors, 5-HT3 receptor, G-protein- coupled receptors.<br><br>

<strong>MEC (Minimum Effective Concentration):</strong><br>
The minimum concentration of a drug in serum required to produce a desired pharmacological effect.<br><br>

<strong>MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration):</strong><br>
The minimum concentration of an antibiotic required to inhibit the growth of susceptible bacteria.<br><br>

<strong>MTC (Minimum Toxic Concentration):</strong><br>
The minimum level of drug concentration that produces toxic effects.<br><br>

</div>
<strong>AUC (Area Under the Curve):</strong><br>
It is the area under the plot of plasma concentration of a drug against time after drug administration.<br><br>

<strong>Cmax:</strong><br>
Maximum concentration achieved in the blood.<br><br>

<strong>Tmax:</strong><br>
Time taken to achieve maximum concentration.<br><br>

<strong>Bioavailability:</strong><br>
The degree to which a drug or other substance becomes available to the target tissue after administration.<br><br>

<strong>First pass metabolism:</strong><br>
Metabolism of drug in the stomach, intestinal wall and liver or in the lung before being reached into the systemic circulation is called first pass metabolism.<br><br>
    
<strong>Half-life (t½)(Plasma Half Life/Elimination half-life):</strong><br>
The half-life of a drug is the length of time for a drug to reduce half(50%) of its initial concentration
from the blood stream.<br>    
e.g. Half-life of Rabeprazole: 1-2 hours, <br>  
Cefixime: 3-4 hours, <br>
Azithromycin: 68 hours.<br><br>  

A drug's half-life is an important factor when it's time to stop taking it. Both the strength and duration of the medication will be considered, as will its half-life. This is important because you risk unpleasant withdrawal symptoms if you quit cold turkey.<br>
All the dosing and the frequency calculations are based on the concept of the plasma half life of a drug. In general, when less than 10% of the originaly given drug is present in blood, you should give new dose of the drug.<br><br>

100mg<br>
50mg<br>
2hrs<br>
t/2<br><br>

100%-- 1st t½--50%<br>
50%-- 2nd t½--25%<br>
25%-- 3rd t½--12.5%<br>
12.5%-- 4th t½--6.25%<br><br>

Amoxicillin- Half life 1.5 hrs<br>
1.5 hrs X 4= 6 hrs <br>
6 hourly every new dose/ QID<br><br>

<strong>How do you calculate the half-life of a drug plasma?:</strong><br>
In brief :<br>
Half-life (t½) is the time required to reduce the concentration of a drug by half.<br>
The formula for half-life is (t½ = 0.693 × Vd /CL)<br>
Volume of distribution (Vd) and clearance (CL) are required to calculate this variable.<br><br>

<strong>What increases half life of a drug?:</strong><br>
Half life is increased by an increase in the volume of distribution and increased by a decrease in the rate of clearance.<br><br>

<strong>Affinity:</strong><br>
It is the tendency of a drug to bind with a receptor.<br><br>

<strong>Efficacy:</strong><br>
Capacity of a drug to bind with the receptor and produce pharmacological effect.<br><br>

<strong>Potency:</strong><br>
Any response or effect of a drug by a fixed dose is called potency.<br><br>

<strong>Booster dose:</strong><br>
It is the dose which is given after sometime of an initial dose to enhance the effects.<br>
e.g. Anti-tetanus booster dose is given 5 years after initial dose.<br><br>
 
<strong>LD 50:</strong><br>
It means Lethal Dose 50%. It is the dose which causes death of 50% of test population.<br><br>

<strong>ED 50:</strong><br>
It means Effective Dose 50%. It is the dose which produces desired pharmacological effect
in 50% of test population.<br><br>

<strong>Chemotherapy:</strong><br>
It is a branch of Pharmacology which deals with the effects of drugs upon microorganisms, parasites & cancer cells.<br><br>

<strong>Radiotherapy:</strong><br>
It is a branch of Pharmacology which deals with treatment of tumors with high energy X-rays (radiation).<br><br>

<strong>Antioxidant:</strong><br>
An antioxidant is a molecule that inhibits the oxidation of other molecules. <br>
e.g. Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid), Vitamin E (Alpha-tocopherol), Vitamin E, Beta-carotene, Lutein etc.<br><br>

<strong>Oxidation:</strong><br>
It is a chemical reaction that can produce free radicals, leading to chain reactions that may damage cells.<br><br>

<strong>Free radical:</strong><br>
An organic compound having some unpaired valence electrons. Free radicals can damage cells and are believed to accelerate the progression of cancer, cardiovascular disease and age-related diseases,<br>
e.g. hydroxyl radical (•OH).<br><br>

<strong>Immunity:</strong><br>
The ability of an organism to resist a particular infection or toxin by the action of
specific antibodies or sensitized white blood cells. It is the balanced state of having adequate
biological defenses to fight infection, disease or other unwanted biological invasion.<br><br>

<strong>Antigen:</strong><br>
Antigens are substances that stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies.
Antigens can be bacteria, virus, fungi or allergens that cause infection and disease.<br><br>

<strong>Antibody:</strong><br>
Antibodies are proteins manufactured by the body that help fight against foreign substances called antigens. When an antigen enters the body, it stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies.<br>
e.g. IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD and IgE.(immunoglobulin-Ig)<br><br>

<strong>Toxicity:</strong><br>
The degree to which a substance (a toxin or poison) can harm humans or animals.<br><br>

<strong>Phototoxicity:</strong><br>
The condition resulting from an overexposure to ultraviolet light or from the
combination of exposure to certain wavelengths of light and a phototoxic substance.<br><br>

<strong>Ototoxicity:</strong><br>Ototoxicity is damage to the hearing or balance functions of the ear by drugs or
chemicals.<br><br>

<strong>Cytotoxicity:</strong><br>
A substance that has a toxic effect on certain cells.<br><br>

<strong>Hypersensitivity:</strong><br>
It is a set of undesirable reactions produced by the normal immune system, including allergies and autoimmunity. These reactions may be damaging, uncomfortable or occasionally fatal.<br><br>

<strong>Drug dependence:</strong><br>
Drug dependence is an adaptive state that develops from repeated drug administration and which results in withdrawal upon cessation of drug use.<br><br>

<strong>Drug tolerance:</strong><br>
Tolerance is a person's diminished response to a drug, which occurs when the drug is used repeatedly and the body adapts to the continued presence of the drug.<br><br>

<strong>Side effects:</strong><br>Side effect is an often harmful and unwanted effect of a drug or chemical that
occurs along with the desired effect.<br><br>

<strong>Adverse effects:</strong><br>
Adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from medication. An adverse effect may be termed a "side effect", when judged to be secondary to a main or therapeutic effect.<br><br><br>
